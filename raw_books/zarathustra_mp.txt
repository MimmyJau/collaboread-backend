And Zarathustra spoke thus to the people:\n\n\u201cI teach you the overman. Human being is something that must be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?\n\nAll creatures so far created something beyond themselves; and you want to be the ebb of this great flood and would even rather go back to animals than overcome humans?\n\nWhat is the ape to a human? A laughing stock or a painful embarrassment. And that is precisely what the human shall be to the overman: a laughing stock or a painful embarrassment.\n\nYou have made your way from worm to human, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now a human is still more ape than any ape.\n\nBut whoever is wisest among you is also just a conflict and a cross between plant and ghost. But do I implore you to become ghosts or plants?\n\nBehold, I teach you the overman!\n\nThe overman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the overman shall be the meaning of the earth!\n\nI beseech you, my brothers, remain faithful to the earth and do not believe those who speak to you of extraterrestrial hopes! They are mixers of poisons whether they know it or not.\n\nThey are despisers of life, dying off and self-poisoned, of whom the earth is weary: so let them fade away!\n\nOnce the sacrilege against God was the greatest sacrilege, but God died, and then all these desecrators died. Now to desecrate the earth is the most terrible thing, and to esteem the bowels of the unfathomable higher than the meaning of the earth!\n\nOnce the soul gazed contemptuously at the body, and then such contempt was the highest thing: it wanted the body gaunt, ghastly, starved.  Thus it intended to escape the body and the earth.\n\nOh this soul was gaunt, ghastly and starved, and cruelty was the lust of this soul!\n\nBut you, too, my brothers, tell me: what does your body proclaim about your soul? Is your soul not poverty and filth and a pitiful contentment?\n\nTruly, mankind is a polluted stream. One has to be a sea to take in a polluted stream without becoming unclean.\n\nBehold, I teach you the overman: he is this sea, in him your great contempt can go under.\n\nWhat is the greatest thing that you can experience? It is the hour of your great contempt. The hour in which even your happiness turns to nausea and likewise your reason and your virtue.\n\nThe hour in which you say: \u2018What matters my happiness? It is poverty and filth, and a pitiful contentment. But my happiness ought to justify existence itself!\u2019\n\nThe hour in which you say: \u2018What matters my reason? Does it crave knowledge like the lion its food? It is poverty and filth and a pitiful contentment!\u2019\n\nThe hour in which you say: \u2018What matters my virtue? It has not yet made me rage. How weary I am of my good and my evil! That is all poverty and filth and a pitiful contentment!\u2019\n\nThe hour in which you say: \u2018What matters my justice? I do not see that I am ember and coal. But the just person is ember and coal!\u2019\n\nThe hour in which you say: \u2018What matters my pity? Is pity not the cross on which he is nailed who loves humans? But my pity is no crucifixion.\u2019\n\nHave you yet spoken thus? Have you yet cried out thus? Oh that I might have heard you cry out thus!\n\nNot your sin \u2013 your modesty cries out to high heaven, your stinginess even in sinning cries out to high heaven!\n\nWhere is the lightning that would lick you with its tongue? Where is the madness with which you should be inoculated?\n\nBehold, I teach you the overman: he is this lightning, he is this madness! \u2013\u201d\n\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken thus someone from the crowd cried out:\n\n\u201cWe have heard enough already about the tightrope walker, now let us see him too!\u201d And all the people laughed at Zarathustra.

Education they call it, it distinguishes them from goatherds.\r\n\r\nFor that reason they hate to hear the word \u2018contempt\u2019 applied to them. So I shall address their pride instead.\r\n\r\nThus I shall speak to them of the most contemptible person: but he is the last human being.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd thus spoke Zarathustra to the people:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt is time that mankind set themselves a goal. It is time that mankind plant the seed of their highest hope.\r\n\r\nTheir soil is still rich enough for this. But one day this soil will be poor and tame, and no tall tree will be able to grow from it anymore.\r\n\r\nBeware! The time approaches when human beings no longer launch the arrow of their longing beyond the human, and the string of their bow will have forgotten how to whir!\r\n\r\nI say to you: one must still have chaos in oneself in order to give birth to a dancing star. I say to you: you still have chaos in you.\r\n\r\nBeware! The time approaches when human beings will no longer give birth to a dancing star. Beware! The time of the most contemptible human is coming, the one who can no longer have contempt for himself.\r\n\r\nBehold! I show you the last human being.\r\n\r\n\u2018What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?\u2019 \u2013 thus asks the last human being, blinking.\r\n\r\nThen the earth has become small, and on it hops the last human being, who makes everything small. His kind is ineradicable, like the flea beetle; the last human being lives longest.\r\n\r\n\u2018We invented happiness\u2019 \u2013 say the last human beings, blinking.\r\n\r\nThey abandoned the regions where it was hard to live: for one needs warmth. One still loves one\u2019s neighbor and rubs up against him: for one needs warmth.\r\n\r\nBecoming ill and being mistrustful are considered sinful by them: one proceeds with caution. A fool who still stumbles over stones or humans!\r\n\r\nA bit of poison once in a while; that makes for pleasant dreams. And much poison at the end, for a pleasant death.\r\n\r\nOne still works, for work is a form of entertainment. But one sees to it that the entertainment is not a strain.\r\n\r\nOne no longer becomes poor and rich: both are too burdensome. Who wants to rule anymore? Who wants to obey anymore? Both are too burdensome.\r\n\r\nNo shepherd and one herd! Each wants the same, each is the same, and whoever feels differently goes voluntarily into the insane asylum.\r\n\r\n\u2018Formerly the whole world was insane\u2019 \u2013 the finest ones say, blinking.\r\n\r\nOne is clever and knows everything that has happened, and so there is no end to their mockery. People still quarrel but they reconcile quickly \u2013 otherwise it is bad for the stomach.\r\n\r\nOne has one\u2019s little pleasure for the day and one\u2019s little pleasure for the night: but one honors health. \u2018We invented happiness\u2019 say the last human beings, and they blink.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd here ended the first speech of Zarathustra, which is also called \u201cThe Prologue,\u201d for at this point he was interrupted by the yelling and merriment of the crowd. \u201cGive us this last human being, oh Zarathustra\u201d \u2013 thus they cried \u2013 \u201cmake us into these last human beings! Then we will make you a gift of the overman!\u201d And all the people jubilated and clicked their tongues. But Zarathustra grew sad and said to his heart:\r\n\r\n\u201cThey do not understand me. I am not the mouth for these ears.\r\n\r\nToo long apparently I lived in the mountains, too much I listened to brooks and trees: now I speak to them as to goatherds.\r\n\r\nMy soul is calm and bright as the morning mountains. But they believe I am cold, that I jeer, that I deal in terrible jests.\r\n\r\nAnd now they look at me and laugh, and in laughing they hate me too.

Whoever feeds the hungry quickens his own soul \u2013 thus speaks wisdom.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe old man went away but returned promptly and offered Zarathus- tra bread and wine. \u201cThis is a bad region for those who hunger,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is why I live here. Beast and human being come to me, the hermit. But bid your companion eat and drink, he is wearier than you.\u201d Zarathustra replied: \u201cMy companion is dead, I would have a hard time persuading him.\u201d \u201cThat does not concern me,\u201d snapped the old man. \u201cWhoever knocks at my house must also take what I offer him. Eat and take care!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThereupon Zarathustra walked again for two hours, trusting the path and the light of the stars, for he was a practiced night-walker and loved to look in the face of all sleepers. But as dawn greyed Zarathustra found himself in a deep wood and no more path was visible to him. Then he laid the dead man into a hollow tree \u2013 for he wanted to protect him from the wolves \u2013 and he laid himself down head first at the tree, upon the earth and the moss. And soon he fell asleep, weary in body but with a calm soul."}, "id": 12}, {"data": {"uuid": "dbac32ae-360c-4b22-8b16-e34bc71c8a2b", "user": 1, "title": "9", "created_on": "2023-05-10 13:59:02.059363+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 13:59:02.073040+00:00", "article_html": "<h3>9</h3><p>Long Zarathustra slept, and not only the dawn passed over his face but the morning as well.

It kneels down like a camel and wants to be well loaded.\r\n\r\nWhat is heaviest, you heroes? thus asks the carrying spirit, so that I might take it upon myself and rejoice in my strength.\r\n\r\nIs it not this: lowering oneself in order to hurt one\u2019s pride? Letting one\u2019s foolishness glow in order to mock one\u2019s wisdom?\r\n\r\nOr is it this: abandoning our cause when it celebrates victory? Climbing high mountains in order to tempt the tempter?\r\n\r\nOr is it this: feeding on the acorns and grass of knowledge and for the sake of truth suffering hunger in one\u2019s soul?\r\n\r\nOr is it this: being ill and sending the comforters home and making friends with the deaf who never hear what you want?\r\n\r\nOr is it this: wading into dirty water when it is the water of truth, and not shrinking away from cold frogs and hot toads?\r\n\r\nOr is it this: loving those who despise us, and extending a hand to the ghost when it wants to frighten us?\r\n\r\nAll of these heaviest things the carrying spirit takes upon itself, like a loaded camel that hurries into the desert, thus it hurries into its desert.\r\n\r\nBut in the loneliest desert the second metamorphosis occurs. Here the spirit becomes lion, it wants to hunt down its freedom and be master in its own desert.\r\n\r\nHere it seeks its last master, and wants to fight him and its last god. For victory it wants to battle the great dragon.\r\n\r\nWho is the great dragon whom the spirit no longer wants to call master and god? \u201cThou shalt\u201d is the name of the great dragon. But the spirit of the lion says \u201cI will.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThou shalt\u201d stands in its way, gleaming golden, a scaly animal, and upon every scale \u201cthou shalt!\u201d gleams like gold.\r\n\r\nThe values of millennia gleam on these scales, and thus speaks the most powerful of all dragons: \u201cthe value of all things \u2013 it gleams in me.\r\n\r\nAll value has already been created, and the value of all created things \u2013 that am I. Indeed, there shall be no more \u2018I will!\u2019\u201d Thus speaks the dragon.\r\n\r\nMy brothers, why is the lion required by the spirit? Why does the beast of burden, renouncing and reverent, not suffice?\r\n\r\nTo create new values \u2013 not even the lion is capable of that: but to create freedom for itself for new creation \u2013 that is within the power of the lion.\r\n\r\nTo create freedom for oneself and also a sacred No to duty: for that, my brothers, the lion is required.\r\n\r\nTo take the right to new values \u2013 that is the most terrible taking for a carrying and reverent spirit. Indeed, it is preying, and the work of a predatory animal.\r\n\r\nOnce it loved \u201cthou shalt\u201d as its most sacred, now it must find delusion and despotism even in what is most sacred to it, in order to wrest freedom from its love by preying. The lion is required for this preying.\r\n\r\nBut tell me, my brothers, of what is the child capable that even the lion is not? Why must the preying lion still become a child?\r\n\r\nThe child is innocence and forgetting, a new beginning, a game, a wheel rolling out of itself, a first movement, a sacred yes-saying.\r\n\r\nYes, for the game of creation my brothers a sacred yes-saying is required. The spirit wants its will, the one lost to the world now wins its own world.\r\n\r\nThree metamorphoses of the spirit I named for you: how the spirit became a camel, and the camel a lion, and finally the lion a child. \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra.

I overcame myself, my suffering self, I carried my own ashes to the mountain, I invented a brighter flame for myself and behold!

Thus I speak to the hinterworldly.\r\n\r\nIt was suffering and incapacity that created all hinterworlds, and that brief madness of happiness that only the most suffering person experiences.\r\n\r\nWeariness that wants its ultimate with one great leap, with a death leap; a poor unknowing weariness that no longer even wants to will: that created all gods and hinterworlds.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my brothers!

One more century of readers \u2013 and the spirit itself will stink.\r\n\r\nThat everyone is allowed to learn to read ruins not only writing in the long run, but thinking too.\r\n\r\nOnce the spirit was God, then it became human and now it is even becoming rabble.\r\n\r\nWhoever writes in blood and proverbs does not want to be read, but to be learned by heart.\r\n\r\nIn the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that one must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those who are addressed should be great and tall.\r\n\r\nThe air thin and pure, danger near and the spirit full of cheerful spite: these fit together well.\r\n\r\nI want to have goblins around me, for I am courageous. Courage that scares off ghosts creates its own goblins \u2013 courage wants to laugh.\r\n\r\nI no longer sympathize with you; this cloud beneath me, this black and heavy thing at which I laugh \u2013 precisely this is your thundercloud.\r\n\r\nYou look upward when you long for elevation. And I look down because I am elevated.\r\n\r\nWho among you can laugh and be elevated at the same time?\r\n\r\nWhoever climbs the highest mountain laughs at all tragic plays and tragic realities.\r\n\r\nCourageous, unconcerned, sarcastic, violent \u2013 thus wisdom wants us: she is a woman and always loves only a warrior.\r\n\r\nYou say to me: \u201cLife is hard to bear.\u201d But why would you have your pride in the morning and your resignation in the evening?\r\n\r\nLife is hard to bear: but then do not carry on so tenderly! We are all of us handsome, load bearing jack- and jillasses.\r\n\r\nWhat have we in common with the rosebud that trembles because a drop of dew lies on its body?\r\n\r\nIt is true: we love life not because we are accustomed to life but because we are accustomed to love.\r\n\r\nThere is always some madness in love. But there is also always some reason in madness.\r\n\r\nAnd even to me, one who likes life, it seems butterflies and soap bubbles and whatever is of their kind among human beings know most about happiness.\r\n\r\nTo see these light, foolish, delicate, sensitive little souls fluttering \u2013 that seduces Zarathustra to tears and songs.\r\n\r\nI would only believe in a god who knew how to dance.\r\n\r\nAnd when I saw my devil, there I found him earnest, thorough, deep, somber: it was the spirit of gravity \u2013 through him all things fall.\r\n\r\nNot by wrath does one kill, but by laughing.

Do you want to seek the way to yourself? Linger a bit longer and listen to me.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhoever seeks easily gets lost himself. All isolation is guilt,\u201d thus speaks the herd. And long have you belonged to the herd.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the herd will still resonate in you too. And when you will say \u201cI no longer am of one conscience with you,\u201d then it will be a lament and a pain.\r\n\r\nBehold, this pain itself bore the one conscience, and the last shimmer of this conscience still glows on your misery.\r\n\r\nBut you want to go the way of your misery, which is the way to yourself? Then show me your right and your strength to it!\r\n\r\nAre you a new strength and a new right? A first movement? A wheel rolling out of itself? Can you compel even the stars to revolve around you?\r\n\r\nOh, there is so much lust for the heights! There are so many spasms of the ambitious! Show me that you are not one of the lustful and the ambitious!\r\n\r\nOh, there are so many great thoughts that do nothing more than a bellows: they puff up and make emptier.\r\n\r\nYou call yourself free? Your dominating thought I want to hear, and not that you escaped from a yoke.\r\n\r\nAre you the kind of person who had the right to escape from a yoke? There are some who threw away their last value when they threw away their servitude.\r\n\r\nFree from what? What does Zarathustra care! But brightly your eyes should signal to me: free for what?\r\n\r\nCan you give yourself your own evil and good and hang your will above yourself like a law? Can you be your own judge and the avenger of your law?\r\n\r\nIt is terrible to be alone with the judge and avenger of one\u2019s own law. Thus does a star get thrown out into desolate space and into the icy breath of solitary being.\r\n\r\nToday you suffer still from the many, you lonely one: for today you still have your courage and your hopes intact.\r\n\r\nBut one day solitude will make you weary, one day your pride will cringe and your courage will gnash its teeth. One day you will cry \u201cI am alone!\u201d\r\n\r\nOne day will you will no longer see your high, and your low will be all too near; your sublimity itself will frighten you like a ghost. One day you will cry: \u201cEverything is false!\u201d\r\n\r\nThere are feelings that want to kill the lonely one; if they do not suc- ceed, well, then they must die themselves! But are you capable of being a murderer?\r\n\r\nDo you know the word \u201ccontempt\u201d yet, my brother? And the agony of your justice, namely to be just to those who despise you?\r\n\r\nYou compel many to relearn about you; they weigh that heavily against you. You came near to them and yet passed by: they will never forgive you that.\r\n\r\nYou pass over and beyond them, but the higher you climb the smaller you are to the eyes of envy. But the ones who fly they hate most.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow would you be just toward me?\u201d \u2013 you must say \u2013 \u201cI choose your injustice as my fair share.\u201d\r\n\r\nInjustice and filth they throw at the lonely one. But my brother, if you want to be a star then you must shine through for them all the more!\r\n\r\nAnd beware of the good and the just! They like to crucify those who invent their own virtue \u2013 they hate the lonely one.\r\n\r\nBeware too of holy simplicity! Everything is unholy to it that is not simple; it also likes to play with fire \u2013 the stake.\r\n\r\nAnd beware of the attacks of your love! Too quickly the lonely one extends his hand to those he encounters.\r\n\r\nTo some people you should not give your hand, but instead only your paw: and I want that your paw also has claws.\r\n\r\nBut the worst enemy whom you can encounter will always be yourself; you ambush yourself in caves and woods.\r\n\r\nLonely one, you go the way to yourself! And past you yourself leads your way and past your seven devils!\r\n\r\nTo your own self you will be heretic and witch and soothsayer and fool and doubter and unholy man and villain.\r\n\r\nYou must want to burn yourself up in your own flame: how could you become new if you did not first become ashes!\r\n\r\nLonely one, you go the way of the creator: you will create yourself a god out of your seven devils!\r\n\r\nLonely one, you go the way of the lover: you love yourself and that is why you despise yourself as only lovers despise.\r\n\r\nThe lover wants to create because he despises!

Would that he were never born! \u2013 Thus I advise the superfluous.\r\n\r\nBut even the superfluous boast about their dying, and even the hollowest nut still wants to be cracked.\r\n\r\nEveryone regards dying as important; but death is not yet a festival. As of yet people have not learned how to consecrate the most beautiful festivals.\r\n\r\nI show you the consummating death that becomes a goad and a promise to the living.\r\n\r\nThe consummated one dies his death, victorious, surrounded by those who hope and promise.\r\n\r\nThus one should learn to die; and there should be no festival where such a dying person does not swear oaths to the living!\r\n\r\nTo die thus is best; second best, however, is to die fighting and to squander a great soul.\r\n\r\nBut your grinning death, the one that creeps up like a thief and yet comes as master \u2013 it is hated as much by the fighter as by the victor.\r\n\r\nMy death I praise to you, the free death that comes to me because I want.\r\n\r\nAnd when will I want it? \u2013 Whoever has a goal and an heir wants death at the right time for his goal and heir.\r\n\r\nAnd out of reverence for his goal and heir he will no longer hang withered wreaths in the sanctuary of life.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I do not want to be like the rope makers: they stretch out their threads and in doing so always walk backwards.\r\n\r\nSome become too old even for their truths and victories; a toothless mouth no longer has the right to every truth.\r\n\r\nAnd everyone who wants to have fame must take leave of honor from time to time and practice the difficult art of leaving \u2013 at the right time.\r\n\r\nOne must stop letting oneself be eaten when one tastes best; this is known by those who want to be loved for a long time.\r\n\r\nThere are sour apples, to be sure, whose lot demands that they wait for the last day of autumn; and immediately they become ripe, yellow and wrinkled.\r\n\r\nWith some the heart ages first and with others the mind.

Thus they came to a crossroads; then Zarathustra told them he wanted to walk alone now, for he was a friend of walking alone. In parting, however, his disciples presented him with a staff upon whose golden knob a snake encircled the sun. Zarathustra was delighted with the staff and leaned on it; then he spoke thus to his disciples.</p><p>Tell me now: how did gold come to have the highest value? Because it is uncommon and useless and gleaming and mild in its luster; it bestows itself always.</p><p>Only as the image of the highest virtue did gold come to have the highest value. Goldlike gleams the gaze of the bestower. Golden luster makes peace between moon and sun.</p><p>Uncommon is the highest virtue and useless, it is gleaming and mild in its luster: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue.</p><p>Truly, I guess you well, my disciples: like me you strive for the bestowing virtue. What would you have in common with cats or wolves?</p><p>This is your thirst: to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves, and there- fore you thirst to amass all riches in your soul.</p><p>Insatiably your soul strives for treasures and gems, because your virtue is insatiable in wanting to bestow.</p><p>You compel all things to and into yourselves, so that they may gush back from your well as the gifts of your love.</p><p>Indeed, such a bestowing love must become a robber of all values, but hale and holy I call this selfishness.</p><p>There is another selfishness, one all too poor, a hungering one that always wants to steal; that selfishness of the sick, the sick selfishness.</p><p>With the eye of the thief it looks at all that gleams; with the greed of hunger it eyes those with ample food; and always it creeps around the table of the bestowers.</p><p>Sickness speaks out of such craving and invisible degeneration; the thieving greed of this selfishness speaks of a diseased body.</p><p>Tell me, my brothers: what do we regard as bad and worst? Is it not degeneration? \u2013 And we always diagnose degeneration where the bestowing soul is absent.</p><p>Upward goes our way, over from genus to super-genus. But a horror to us is the degenerating sense which speaks: \u201cEverything for me.\u201d</p><p>Upward flies our sense; thus it is a parable of our body, a parable of elevation. Such elevation parables are the names of the virtues.</p><p>Thus the body goes through history, becoming and fighting. And the spirit \u2013 what is it to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, companion and echo.</p><p>Parables are all names of good and evil: they do not express, they only hint. A fool who wants to know of them!</p><p>Pay attention, my brothers, to every hour where your spirit wants to speak in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.</p><p>There your body is elevated and resurrected; with its bliss it delights the spirit, which becomes creator and esteemer and lover and benefactor of all things.</p><p>When your heart flows broad and full like a river, a blessing and a danger to adjacent dwellers: there is the origin of your virtue.</p><p>When you are sublimely above praise and blame, and your will wants to command all things, as the will of a lover: there is the origin of your virtue.</p><p>When you despise pleasantness and the soft bed, and cannot bed down far enough away from the softies: there is the origin of your virtue.</p><p>When you are the ones who will with a single will, and this turning point of all need points to your necessity: there is the origin of your virtue.</p><p>Indeed, it is a new good and evil! Indeed, a new, deep rushing and the voice of a new spring!</p><p>It is power, this new virtue; it is a ruling thought and around it a wise soul: a golden sun and around it the snake of knowledge.</p><h3>2</h3><p>Here Zarathustra was silent for a while and looked with love at his disci- ples. Then he continued to speak thus \u2013 and his voice had transformed.</p><p>Remain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue! Let your bestowing love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth! Thus I beg and beseech you.</p><p>Do not let it fly away from earthly things and beat against eternal walls with its wings!

Thus they came to a crossroads; then Zarathustra told them he wanted to walk alone now, for he was a friend of walking alone. In parting, however, his disciples presented him with a staff upon whose golden knob a snake encircled the sun. Zarathustra was delighted with the staff and leaned on it; then he spoke thus to his disciples.\r\n\r\nTell me now: how did gold come to have the highest value? Because it is uncommon and useless and gleaming and mild in its luster; it bestows itself always.\r\n\r\nOnly as the image of the highest virtue did gold come to have the highest value. Goldlike gleams the gaze of the bestower. Golden luster makes peace between moon and sun.\r\n\r\nUncommon is the highest virtue and useless, it is gleaming and mild in its luster: a bestowing virtue is the highest virtue.\r\n\r\nTruly, I guess you well, my disciples: like me you strive for the bestowing virtue. What would you have in common with cats or wolves?\r\n\r\nThis is your thirst: to become sacrifices and gifts yourselves, and there- fore you thirst to amass all riches in your soul.\r\n\r\nInsatiably your soul strives for treasures and gems, because your virtue is insatiable in wanting to bestow.\r\n\r\nYou compel all things to and into yourselves, so that they may gush back from your well as the gifts of your love.\r\n\r\nIndeed, such a bestowing love must become a robber of all values, but hale and holy I call this selfishness.\r\n\r\nThere is another selfishness, one all too poor, a hungering one that always wants to steal; that selfishness of the sick, the sick selfishness.\r\n\r\nWith the eye of the thief it looks at all that gleams; with the greed of hunger it eyes those with ample food; and always it creeps around the table of the bestowers.\r\n\r\nSickness speaks out of such craving and invisible degeneration; the thieving greed of this selfishness speaks of a diseased body.\r\n\r\nTell me, my brothers: what do we regard as bad and worst? Is it not degeneration? \u2013 And we always diagnose degeneration where the bestowing soul is absent.\r\n\r\nUpward goes our way, over from genus to super-genus. But a horror to us is the degenerating sense which speaks: \u201cEverything for me.\u201d\r\n\r\nUpward flies our sense; thus it is a parable of our body, a parable of elevation. Such elevation parables are the names of the virtues.\r\n\r\nThus the body goes through history, becoming and fighting. And the spirit \u2013 what is it to the body? The herald of its fights and victories, companion and echo.\r\n\r\nParables are all names of good and evil: they do not express, they only hint. A fool who wants to know of them!\r\n\r\nPay attention, my brothers, to every hour where your spirit wants to speak in parables: there is the origin of your virtue.\r\n\r\nThere your body is elevated and resurrected; with its bliss it delights the spirit, which becomes creator and esteemer and lover and benefactor of all things.\r\n\r\nWhen your heart flows broad and full like a river, a blessing and a danger to adjacent dwellers: there is the origin of your virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen you are sublimely above praise and blame, and your will wants to command all things, as the will of a lover: there is the origin of your virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen you despise pleasantness and the soft bed, and cannot bed down far enough away from the softies: there is the origin of your virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen you are the ones who will with a single will, and this turning point of all need points to your necessity: there is the origin of your virtue.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is a new good and evil! Indeed, a new, deep rushing and the voice of a new spring!\r\n\r\nIt is power, this new virtue; it is a ruling thought and around it a wise soul: a golden sun and around it the snake of knowledge.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nHere Zarathustra was silent for a while and looked with love at his disci- ples. Then he continued to speak thus \u2013 and his voice had transformed.\r\n\r\nRemain faithful to the earth, my brothers, with the power of your virtue! Let your bestowing love and your knowledge serve the meaning of the earth! Thus I beg and beseech you.\r\n\r\nDo not let it fly away from earthly things and beat against eternal walls with its wings! Oh, there has always been so much virtue that flew away!\r\n\r\nLike me, guide the virtue that has flown away back to the earth \u2013 yes, back to the body and life: so that it may give the earth its meaning, a human meaning!\r\n\r\nIn a hundred ways thus far the spirit as well as virtue has flown away and failed. Oh, in our body now all this delusion and failure dwells: there they have become body and will.\r\n\r\nIn a hundred ways thus far spirit as well as virtue has essayed and erred. Indeed, human beings were an experiment. Alas, much ignorance and error have become embodied in us!\r\n\r\nNot only the reason of millennia \u2013 their madness too breaks out in us. It is dangerous to be an heir.\r\n\r\nStill we struggle step by step with the giant called accident, and over all humanity thus far nonsense has ruled, the sense-less.\r\n\r\nLet your spirit and your virtue serve the meaning of the earth, my brothers: and the value of all things will be posited newly by you! Therefore you shall be fighters! Therefore you shall be creators!\r\n\r\nKnowingly the body purifies itself; experimenting with knowledge it elevates itself; all instincts become sacred in the seeker of knowledge; the soul of the elevated one becomes gay.\r\n\r\nPhysician, help yourself: thus also you help your sick. Let that be his best help, that he sees with his own eyes the one who heals himself.\r\n\r\nThere are a thousand paths that have never yet been walked; a thousand healths and hidden islands of life. Human being and human earth are still unexhausted and undiscovered.\r\n\r\nWake and listen, you lonely ones! From the future come winds with secretive wingbeats; good tidings are issued to delicate ears.\r\n\r\nYou lonely of today, you withdrawing ones, one day you shall be a people: from you who have chosen yourselves a chosen people shall grow \u2013 and from them the overman.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the earth shall yet become a site of recovery! And already a new fragrance lies about it, salubrious \u2013 and a new hope!\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nWhen Zarathustra had said these words, he grew silent like one who has\r\n\r\nnot spoken his last word. Long he weighed the staff in his hand, doubtfully.\r\n\r\nFinally he spoke thus, and his voice had transformed.\r\n\r\n\u201cAlone I go now, my disciples! You also should go now, and alone! Thus\r\n\r\nI want it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I counsel you to go away from me and guard yourselves against Zarathustra! And even better: be ashamed of him! Perhaps he deceived you.\r\n\r\nThe person of knowledge must not only be able to love his enemies, but to hate his friends too.\r\n\r\nOne repays a teacher badly if one always remains a pupil only. And why would you not want to pluck at my wreath?\r\n\r\nYou revere me, but what if your reverence falls down some day? Beware that you are not killed by a statue!\r\n\r\nYou say you believe in Zarathustra? But what matters Zarathustra! You are my believers, but what matter all believers!\r\n\r\nYou had not yet sought yourselves, then you found me. All believers do this; that\u2019s why all faith amounts to so little.\r\n\r\nNow I bid you lose me and find yourselves; and only when you have all denied me will I return to you.\r\n\r\nIndeed, with different eyes, my brothers, will I then seek my lost ones; with a different love will I love you then.\r\n\r\nAnd one day again you shall become my friends and children of a single hope; then I shall be with you a third time, to celebrate the great noon with you.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the great noon, where human beings stand at the midpoint of their course between animal and overman and celebrate their way to evening as their highest hope: for it is the way to a new morning.\r\n\r\nThen the one who goes under will bless himself, that he is one who crosses over; and the sun of his knowledge will stand at noon for him.\r\n\r\n\u2018Dead are all gods: now we want the overman to live.\u2019 \u2013 Let this be our last will at the great noon!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 37}]}, {"data": {"uuid": "b488c649-dfa4-4899-b11f-7b67833f7447", "user": 1, "title": "Second Part", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:19:01.875130+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:19:01.887164+00:00", "article_html": "<h1>Second Part</h1>", "article_json": {"type": "doc", "content": [{"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 1}, "content": [{"text": "Second Part", "type": "text"}]}]}, "article_text": "Second Part"}, "id": 38, "children": [{"data": {"uuid": "cffec51a-e886-4a1e-8b97-dbb9903a435f", "user": 1, "title": "The Child with the Mirror", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:19:53.991551+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:19:54.005551+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Child with the Mirror</h2><p>At this time Zarathustra returned again to the mountains and to the solitude of his cave and withdrew from mankind, waiting like a sower who has cast his seeds.

Does he not wander among us like we were animals?\u201d\r\n\r\nBut it is better said this way: \u201cThe seeker of knowledge wanders among human beings as among animals.\u201d\r\n\r\nHuman beings themselves, however, the seeker of knowledge calls: the animal that has red cheeks.\r\n\r\nHow did this happen? Is it not because they have had to be ashamed so often?\r\n\r\nOh my friends! Thus speaks the seeker of knowledge: Shame, shame, shame \u2013 that is the history of human beings!\r\n\r\nAnd that is why the noble person commands himself not to shame; shame he demands of himself before all sufferers.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I do not like them, the merciful who are blissful in their pitying: they lack too much in shame.\r\n\r\nIf I must be pitying, then I certainly do not want to be called such; and if I am, then preferably from a distance.\r\n\r\nGladly would I cover my head and flee before I am recognized, and thus I bid you do as well, my friends!\r\n\r\nMay my destiny always lead those like you, who do not suffer, across my path, and those with whom I may share hope and meal and honey!\r\n\r\nIndeed, I probably did this and that for sufferers, but I always seemed to do myself better when I learned to enjoy myself better.\r\n\r\nEver since there have been humans, the human being has enjoyed himself too little: That alone, my brothers, is our original sin!\r\n\r\nAnd if we learn to enjoy ourselves better, then we forget best how to hurt others and plot hurt for them.\r\n\r\nTherefore I wash the hand that helped the sufferer, therefore too I wipe even my soul.\r\n\r\nFor inasmuch as I saw the sufferer suffering, I was ashamed for the sake of his shame; and when I helped him I severely violated his pride.\r\n\r\nGreat indebtedness does not make people thankful, but vengeful instead; and if the small kindness is not forgotten then it will become a gnawing worm.\r\n\r\n\u201cBe cold in accepting! Let your accepting serve to distinguish!\u201d \u2013 Thus I counsel those who have nothing to give away.\r\n\r\nI, however, am a bestower. Gladly I bestow as friend to friends. But strangers and poor people may pluck the fruit from my tree themselves: that way there is less shame.\r\n\r\nBut beggars should be abolished completely! Indeed, one is angered in giving and angered in not giving to them.\r\n\r\nAnd the same for sinners and bad consciences! Believe me, my friends, bites of conscience teach people to bite.\r\n\r\nWorst, however, are petty thoughts. Indeed, better to do evil than to think small!\r\n\r\nYou say, to be sure: \u201cPleasure in small mischief saves us many a great evil deed.\u201d But here one should not want to save.\r\n\r\nAn evil deed is like a sore: it itches and scratches and ruptures \u2013 it speaks honestly.\r\n\r\n\u201cBehold, I am sickness\u201d \u2013 thus speaks the evil deed, that is its honesty.\r\n\r\nBut a petty thought is like a fungus; it creeps and crouches and does not want to be anywhere \u2013 until the whole body is rotten and wilted with little fungi.\r\n\r\nTo the one who is possessed by the devil, however, I whisper these words in his ear: \u201cBetter to raise your devil until it is big! Even for you there is still a way to greatness!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nOh my brothers! One knows a bit too much about everyone! And though some become transparent to us, we can by no means pass through them on that account.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to live with people because remaining silent is so difficult.\r\n\r\nAnd we are not most unfair toward those who are repugnant to us, but toward those who do not at all concern us.\r\n\r\nBut if you have a suffering friend, then be a resting place to his suffering, yet at the same time a hard bed, a camp bed: thus you will be most useful to him.\r\n\r\nAnd if a friend does evil to you, then say: \u201cI forgive you what you have done to me; but that you did it to yourself \u2013 how could I forgive that!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus speaks all great love; it overcomes even forgiveness and pitying.\r\n\r\nOne should hold on firmly to one\u2019s heart, for if one lets it go, how quickly one then loses one\u2019s head!\r\n\r\nOh, where in the world has greater folly occurred than among the pitying? And what in the world causes more suffering than the folly of the pitying?\r\n\r\nWoe to all lovers who do not yet have an elevation that is above their pitying!\r\n\r\nThus the devil once spoke to me: \u201cEven God has his hell: it is his love for mankind.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd recently I heard him say these words: \u201cGod is dead; God died of his pity for mankind.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus I warn you against pity: from it a heavy cloud is coming to mankind! Indeed, I understand weather forecasting!\r\n\r\nBut note these words too: all great love is above even all its pitying, for it still wants to create the beloved!\r\n\r\n\u201cI offer myself to my love, and my neighbor as myself\u201d \u2013 thus it is said of all creators.\r\n\r\nBut all creators are hard. \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 41}, {"data": {"uuid": "93ae12c4-8afb-4ad5-a3c3-b31d07203ff8", "user": 1, "title": "On Priests", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:22:20.350884+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:22:20.365985+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Priests</h2><p>And once Zarathustra gave a sign to his disciples and spoke these words to them:</p><p>\u201cHere are priests, and though they are my enemies, go quietly past them and with sleeping swords!</p><p>Among them too there are heroes; many of them suffered too much, so they want to make others suffer.</p><p>They are evil enemies: nothing is more vengeful than their humility.

Does life also require the rabble?\r\n\r\nAre poisoned wells and stinking fires and soiled dreams and maggots required in life\u2019s bread?\r\n\r\nNot my hatred but my nausea fed hungrily on my life!

And holding my nose I walked annoyed through all yesterday and today; truly, all yesterday and today smell foul of the writing rabble!\r\n\r\nLike a cripple who became deaf and blind and dumb; thus I lived for a long time, so as not to live with the power-, the scribble-, the pleasure- rabble.\r\n\r\nLaboriously my spirit climbed steps, and cautiously; alms of joy were its refreshment; for the blind man life crept by as if on a cane.\r\n\r\nBut what happened to me? How did I redeem myself from nausea? Who rejuvenated my eyes? How did I manage to fly to the height where no more rabble sits at the well?\r\n\r\nDid my nausea itself create wings for me and water-divining powers? Truly, into the highest regions I had to fly in order to rediscover the wellspring of joy!\r\n\r\nOh I found it, my brothers! Here in the highest regions the wellspring of joy gushes for me! And there is a life from which no rabble drinks!\r\n\r\nAlmost too forcefully you flow, well of joy! And often you empty the cup again in wanting to fill it!\r\n\r\nAnd I must still learn to approach you more modestly; all too forcefully my heart still streams toward you \u2013\r\n\r\nMy heart, upon which my summer burns, the brief, hot, melancholy, superblissful summer; how my summer heart yearns for your coolness!\r\n\r\nGone the hesitating gloom of my spring! Gone the malice of my snowflakes in June! I have become summer and summer noon entirely!\r\n\r\nA summer in the highest regions with cold springs and blissful silence: Oh come, my friends, and let the silence become even more blissful!\r\n\r\nFor it is our height and our homeland; too high and steep we live here for all the unclean and their thirst.\r\n\r\nCast your pure eyes into the wellspring of my joy, you friends!

There is a cleft between giving and receiving; and the closest cleft is the last to be bridged.\r\n\r\nA hunger grows out of my beauty; I wish to harm those for whom I shine, I wish to rob those on whom I have bestowed: \u2013 thus I hunger for malice.\r\n\r\nWithdrawing my hand when a hand already reaches for it; hesitating like the waterfall that hesitates even while plunging \u2013 thus I hunger for malice.\r\n\r\nMy fullness plots such vengeance; such trickery gushes from my loneliness.\r\n\r\nMy happiness in bestowing died in bestowing, my virtue wearied of itself in its superabundance!\r\n\r\nFor one who always bestows, the danger is loss of shame; whoever dispenses always has calloused hands and heart from sheer dispensing.\r\n\r\nMy eye no longer wells up at the shame of those who beg; my hand became too hard for the trembling of filled hands.\r\n\r\nWhere have the tears of my eye and the down of my heart gone? Oh loneliness of all bestowers! Oh muteness of all who shine!\r\n\r\nMany suns revolve in desolate space. To everything that is dark they speak with their light \u2013 to me they are mute.\r\n\r\nOh this is the enmity of light toward that which shines; mercilessly it goes its orbit.\r\n\r\nUnjust in its deepest heart toward that which shines: cold toward suns \u2013 thus every sun goes.\r\n\r\nLike a storm the suns fly their orbit, that is their motion. They follow their inexorable will; that is their coldness.\r\n\r\nOh it is you only, you dark ones, you nocturnal ones, who create warmth out of that which shines! Oh it is you only who drink milk and refreshment from the udders of light!\r\n\r\nAlas, ice surrounds me, my hand burns itself on iciness! Alas, there is thirst in me that yearns for your thirst!\r\n\r\nIt is night: alas that I must be light! And thirst for the nocturnal! And loneliness!\r\n\r\nIt is night: now my longing breaks out of me like a well \u2013 I long to speak.\r\n\r\nIt is night: now all fountains speak more loudly. And my soul too is a fountain.\r\n\r\nIt is night: only now all the songs of the lovers awaken. And my soul too is the song of a lover.\r\n\r\nThus sang Zarathustra."}, "id": 47}, {"data": {"uuid": "86fb09db-6bff-4660-9f05-bec8cc2731e0", "user": 1, "title": "The Dance Song", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:27:43.068035+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:27:43.086665+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Dance Song</h2><p>One evening Zarathustra walked through the woods with his disciples, and as he searched for a well, behold, he then came upon a green meadow that was silently bordered by trees and shrubs; upon it girls danced with each other.

It shall become smooth and subservient to the spirit, as its mirror and reflection.\r\n\r\nThat is your entire will, you wisest ones, as a will to power; and even when you speak of good and evil and of valuations.\r\n\r\nYou still want to create the world before which you could kneel: this is your ultimate hope and intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe unwise, to be sure, the people \u2013 they are like a river on which a skiff floats; valuations are seated in the skiff, solemn and cloaked.\r\n\r\nYour will and your values you set upon the river of becoming; what the people believe to be good and evil reveals to me an ancient will to power.\r\n\r\nIt was you, you wisest ones, who placed such guests into the skiff and gave them pomp and proud names \u2013 you and your dominating will!\r\n\r\nNow the river carries your skiff along: it has to carry it. It matters little whether the breaking wave foams and angrily opposes the keel!\r\n\r\nThe river is not your danger and the end of your good and evil, you wisest ones; but this will itself, the will to power \u2013 the unexhausted begetting will of life.\r\n\r\nBut in order that you understand my words on good and evil, I also want to tell you my words on life and on the nature of all that lives.\r\n\r\nI pursued the living, I walked the greatest and the smallest paths in order to know its nature.\r\n\r\nWith a hundredfold mirror I captured even its glance, when its mouth was closed, so that its eyes could speak to me. And its eyes spoke to me.\r\n\r\nHowever, wherever I found the living, there too I heard the speech on obedience. All living is an obeying.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the second thing that I heard: the one who cannot obey himself is commanded. Such is the nature of the living.\r\n\r\nThis however is the third thing that I heard: that commanding is harder than obeying. And not only that the commander bears the burden of all obeyers, and that this burden easily crushes him: \u2013\r\n\r\nIn all commanding it seemed to me there is an experiment and a risk; and always when it commands, the living risks itself in doing so.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even when it commands itself, even then it must pay for its commanding. It must become the judge and avenger and victim of its own law.\r\n\r\nHow does this happen? I asked myself. What persuades the living to obey and command, and to still practice obedience while commanding?\r\n\r\nHear my words, you wisest ones! Check seriously to see whether I crept into the very heart of life and into the roots of its heart!\r\n\r\nWherever I found the living, there I found the will to power; and even in the will of the serving I found the will to be master.\r\n\r\nThe weaker is persuaded by its own will to serve the stronger, because it wants to be master over what is still weaker: this is the only pleasure it is incapable of renouncing.\r\n\r\nAnd as the smaller gives way to the greater, in order for it to have its pleasure and power over the smallest, so too the greatest gives way, and for the sake of power it risks \u2013 life itself.\r\n\r\nThat is the giving-way of the greatest, that it is a risk and a danger and a tossing of dice unto death.\r\n\r\nAnd where there are sacrificing and favors and love-looks, there too is the will to be master. Along secret passages the weaker sneaks into the fortress and straight to the heart of the more powerful \u2013 and there it steals power.\r\n\r\nAnd this secret life itself spoke to me: \u201cBehold,\u201d it said, \u201cI am that which must always overcome itself.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, you call it will to beget or drive to a purpose, to something higher, more distant, more manifold: but all this is one, and one secret.\r\n\r\nI would rather perish than renounce this one thing; and truly, wher- ever there is decline and the falling of leaves, behold, there life sacrifices itself \u2013 for power!\r\n\r\nThat I must be struggle and becoming and purpose and the contradiction of purposes \u2013 alas, whoever guesses my will guesses also on what crooked paths it must walk!\r\n\r\nWhatever I may create and however I may love it \u2013 soon I must oppose it and my love, thus my will wants it.\r\n\r\nAnd even you, seeker of knowledge, are only a path and footstep of my will; indeed, my will to power follows also on the heels of your will to truth!\r\n\r\nIndeed, the one who shot at truth with the words \u2018will to existence\u2019 did not hit it: this will \u2013 does not exist!\r\n\r\nFor, what is not can not will; but what is in existence, how could this still will to exist!\r\n\r\nOnly where life is, is there also will; but not will to life, instead \u2013 thus I teach you \u2013 will to power!\r\n\r\nMuch is esteemed more highly by life than life itself; yet out of esteeming itself speaks \u2013 the will to power!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus life once taught me, and from this I shall yet solve the riddle of your heart, you wisest ones.\r\n\r\nTruly, I say to you: good and evil that would be everlasting \u2013 there is no such thing! They must overcome themselves out of themselves again and again.\r\n\r\nYou do violence with your values and words of good and evil, you valuators; and this is your hidden love and the gleaming, trembling and flowing-over of your souls.\r\n\r\nBut a stronger force grows out of your values and a new overcoming; upon it egg and eggshell break.\r\n\r\nAnd whoever must be a creator in good and evil \u2013 truly, he must first be an annihilator and break values.\r\n\r\nThus the highest evil belongs to the highest goodness, but this is the creative one. \u2013\r\n\r\nLet us speak of this, you wisest ones, even if it is bad to do so. Keeping silent is worse; all truths that are kept silent become poisonous.\r\n\r\nAnd may everything break that can possibly be broken by our truths! Many a house has yet to be built!\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 50}, {"data": {"uuid": "825f45eb-95f9-4a23-aca5-b2c644089027", "user": 1, "title": "On the Sublime Ones", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:31:59.029490+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:31:59.051091+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On the Sublime Ones</h2><p>The bottom of my sea is calm \u2013 who would guess that it conceals playful monsters?</p><p>My depth is unfathomable, but it gleams with swimming riddles and laughters.</p><p>I saw a sublime one today, a solemn one, an ascetic of the spirit; oh how my soul laughed at his ugliness!</p><p>With his chest sticking out like those who hold their breath he stood there, the sublime one, silently:</p><p>Adorned with ugly truths, his hunter\u2019s spoils, and rich in tattered clothing; many thorns clung to him also \u2013 but I saw nary a rose.</p><p>He had not yet learned laughing and beauty.

I do not belong to those whose Why may be questioned.\r\n\r\nIs my experience of yesterday? It has been a long time since I experi- enced the reasons of my opinions.\r\n\r\nWould I not have to be a keg of memory if I were also to have my reasons with me?\r\n\r\nIt is already too much for me to keep my own opinions, and many a bird flies away.\r\n\r\nAnd occasionally I find in my dovecot an animal that has flown to me, a strange one that trembles when I lay my hand upon it.\r\n\r\nYet what did Zarathustra once say to you? That the poets lie too much? \u2013 But Zarathustra too is a poet.\r\n\r\nDo you believe now that he speaks the truth here? Why do you believe that?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe disciple answered: \u201cI believe in Zarathustra.\u201d But Zarathustra shook his head and smiled.\r\n\r\n\u201cFaith does not make me blessed,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially not faith in me.\r\n\r\nBut supposing that someone said in all earnestness that the poets lie too much: he is right \u2013 we lie too much.\r\n\r\nWe also know too little and are bad learners, thus we simply have to lie.\r\n\r\nAnd who of us poets has not watered down his wine? Many a poisonous hodgepodge took place in our cellars, much that is indescribable was enacted there.\r\n\r\nAnd because we know little, we take a hearty liking to the spiritually impoverished, especially when they are little young women!\r\n\r\nAnd we are even keen for those things that little old women tell each other evenings. Within ourselves we call that \u2018the eternal feminine.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd as if there were a special, secret portal to knowledge that becomes blocked to those who learn something, thus we believe in the people and their \u2018wisdom.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut this is what all poets believe: that whoever pricks up his ears while lying in the grass or on a lonely slope will divine something about the things that are situated between heaven and earth.\r\n\r\nAnd if tender stirrings come to them, then the poets always think that nature herself is in love with them:\r\n\r\nAnd she creeps up to their ears to tell them secrets and enamored flatteries, the like of which makes them boastful and bloated before all mortals!\r\n\r\nIndeed, there are so many things between heaven and earth of which only the poets have dreamed!\r\n\r\nAnd especially above the heavens, for all gods are poets\u2019 parable, poets\u2019 cock and bull!\r\n\r\nIndeed, always it lifts us up \u2013 namely to the kingdom of the clouds; atop these we set our motley bastards and then call them gods and overmen \u2013\r\n\r\nAnd they are just light enough for these chairs \u2013 all these gods and overmen!\r\n\r\nOh how I am weary of all this imperfection that is supposed to become an event at any cost!\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken thus, his disciple was angry with him, but he remained silent. And Zarathustra too remained silent, and his gaze had turned inward, as if he were gazing into vast distances. At last he sighed and took a breath.\r\n\r\n\u201cI am of today and of the past,\u201d he said then. \u201cBut there is something in me that is of tomorrow and the day after tomorrow and of days to come.\r\n\r\nI became weary of the poets, the old and the new; superficial they all are to me and shallow seas.\r\n\r\nThey did not think sufficiently to the depths, therefore their feeling did not get to the bottom.\r\n\r\nA bit of lust and a bit of boredom \u2013 that so far has been their best contemplation.\r\n\r\nGhost whispers and whisking I consider all their harp jingle jangle; what have they ever known of the ardor of tones! \u2013\r\n\r\nNor are they clean enough for me; they all muddy their water to make it seem deep.\r\n\r\nAnd though they gladly pose as reconcilers, to me they remain middle- men mixers and half-and-halfs and unclean! \u2013\r\n\r\nIndeed, I cast my net into their seas and wanted to catch good fish; but always I hauled in an ancient god\u2019s head.\r\n\r\nThus the sea gave a stone to the hungry. And the poets themselves may well come from the sea.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, one finds pearls in them, and they are all the more similar to hard shellfish. And instead of a soul I often found salty slime in them.\r\n\r\nThey also learned vanity from the sea; isn\u2019t the sea the peacock of peacocks?\r\n\r\nEven before the ugliest of all buffaloes it fans its tail, it never tires of its silver and silky fans of lace.\r\n\r\nDefiantly the buffalo looks on, in his soul close to the sand, still closer to the thicket, but closest to the swamp.\r\n\r\nWhat does he care of beauty and sea and peacock\u2019s finery? This parable I say to the poets.\r\n\r\nTruly, their spirit itself is this peacock of peacocks and a sea of vanity!\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the poet wants spectators: even if they have to be buffaloes! \u2013\r\n\r\nBut I became weary of this spirit, and I foresee that it will become weary of itself.\r\n\r\nTransformed I have already seen the poets, and turning their gaze against themselves.\r\n\r\nI saw ascetics of the spirit approaching; they grew out of the poets.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 55}, {"data": {"uuid": "9ba0b923-cc0b-4431-93d2-98a4970a7dcf", "user": 1, "title": "On Great Events", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:36:11.464385+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:36:11.482268+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Great Events</h2><p>There is an island in the sea \u2013 not far from the blessed isles of Zarathustra \u2013 on which a fiery mountain smokes continually; the people say of it, and especially the little old women among the people say of it, that it was placed like a huge boulder before the gate to the underworld: but through the fiery mountain itself leads the narrow path that winds downward to this gate of the underworld.</p><p>Now it was around the time that Zarathustra sojourned on the blessed isles that a ship dropped anchor at the island on which the smoking mountain stands, and its crew went ashore to shoot rabbits.

It is high time!\u201d As the figure came closest to them \u2013 and it flew past quickly like a shadow in the direction of the fiery mountain \u2013 they recognized with the greatest dismay that it was Zarathustra; for all of them had seen him before, except for the captain himself, and they loved him as the people love, with equal parts of love and awe.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust look!\u201d said the old helmsman, \u201cthere goes Zarathustra off to hell!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nAround the same time that these sailors landed on the fiery island the rumor was circulating that Zarathustra had disappeared; and when people asked his friends, they related how he had departed by ship at night, without saying where he would be traveling.\r\n\r\nThus a restlessness arose, but three days later this restlessness was increased by the sailors\u2019 story \u2013 and now all the people were saying that the devil had fetched Zarathustra. His disciples laughed at this news, to be sure, and one of them even said: \u201cI would sooner believe that Zarathustra fetched himself the devil.\u201d But at the bottom of their souls all of them were filled with worry and longing, and so their joy was great when on the fifth day Zarathustra appeared among them.\r\n\r\nAnd this is the story of Zarathustra\u2019s conversation with the fire hound.\r\n\r\n\u201cThe earth,\u201d he said, \u201chas a skin; and this skin has diseases. One of these diseases for example is called: \u2018Human being.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd another of these diseases is called \u2018fire hound\u2019; about him people have told each other many lies and allowed themselves to be lied to much.\r\n\r\nTo fathom this mystery I went over the sea, and I saw the naked truth, indeed, barefoot up to its throat!\r\n\r\nNow I know what the fire hound is all about, and likewise all the underhanded and overthrowing scum-devils of whom not only little old women are afraid.\r\n\r\n\u2018Out with you, fire hound, out of your depth!\u2019 I cried, \u2018and confess how deep is this depth! Where did you get what you are snorting there?\r\n\r\nYou drink deeply from the sea; your salty eloquence betrays that! Really, for a hound of the depths you take your nourishment too much from the surface!\r\n\r\nAt best I could regard you as the ventriloquist of the earth; and always when I heard overthrowing and underhanded scum-devils speaking, I found them to be the same as you: salty, lying and superficial.\r\n\r\nYou know how to bellow and to darken with ashes! You are the best big mouths, and you\u2019ve learned more than enough about bringing mud to a boil.\r\n\r\nWherever you are, there mud always has to be close by, and much that is spongy, pitted, squeezed, and wants to break free.\r\n\r\n\u201cFreedom\u201d the lot of you are best at bellowing, but I lose faith in \u201cgreat events\u201d as soon as they are surrounded by much bellowing and smoke.\r\n\r\nAnd just believe me, friend Infernal Racket! The greatest events \u2013 these are not our loudest, but our stillest hours.\r\n\r\nNot around the inventors of new noise does the world revolve, but around the inventors of new values; inaudibly it revolves.\r\n\r\nAnd just confess! When your noise and smoke cleared, it was always very little that had happened. What does it matter that a town becomes a mummy and a statue lies in the mud!\r\n\r\nAnd these words I say to all overthrowers of statues. Surely it is the greatest folly to throw salt into the sea and statues into the mud.\r\n\r\nIn the mud of your contempt lay the statue, but precisely this is its law, that out of contempt life and living beauty grow back to it!\r\n\r\nIt stands up again with even more godlike features, seductive in its suffering, and truly! It will yet thank you for overthrowing it, you overthrowers!\r\n\r\nBut this advice I give to kings and churches and to all that is feeble with age and feeble in virtue \u2013 just let yourselves be overthrown! So that you might come to life again, and to you \u2013 virtue!\u2019 \u2013\r\n\r\nThus I spoke before the fire hound, then it interrupted me sullenly and asked: \u2018Church? What is that?\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2018Church?\u2019 I answered, \u2018that is a kind of state, and in fact the most lying kind. But be silent, you hypocrite hound! You already know your kind best!\r\n\r\nLike you yourself the state is a hypocrite hound; like you it likes to speak with smoke and bellowing \u2013 to make believe, like you, that it speaks from the belly of things.\r\n\r\nFor it wants absolutely to be the most important animal on earth, this state; and people believe it, too.\u2019 \u2013\r\n\r\nWhen I finished saying this the fire hound behaved as though out of his mind with envy. \u2018What?\u2019 it shouted, \u2018the most important animal on earth? And they believe it too?\u2019 And then so much steam and so many horrid voices emanated from his throat that I thought he would choke to death from anger and envy.\r\n\r\nAt last he grew calmer and his panting let up; but as soon as he was calm I said laughing:\r\n\r\n\u2018You are angry, fire hound, therefore I am right about you!\r\n\r\nAnd so that I also remain right, hear now about another fire hound: one who really speaks from the heart of the earth.\r\n\r\nHis breath exhales gold and golden rain \u2013 thus his heart wants it. What are ash and smoke and hot slime to him!\r\n\r\nLaughter flutters out of him like a colorful cloud; he is ill disposed toward your gurgling and spitting and the growling of your bowels!\r\n\r\nBut gold and laughter \u2013 that he takes from the heart of the earth; for you should know \u2013 the heart of the earth is made of gold.\u2019\r\n\r\nWhen the fire hound heard this he could no longer stand to listen to me. Ashamed, he tucked in his tail and barked a feeble \u2018bow-wow,\u2019 then he crawled down into his cave.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus recounted Zarathustra. But his disciples scarcely listened to him, so great was their desire to tell him about the sailors, the rabbits and the flying man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat am I supposed to think of that?\u201d he said. \u201cAm I some kind of ghost?\r\n\r\nBut it must have been my shadow. You must have heard something before about a wanderer and his shadow?\r\n\r\nWhat is certain, however, is that I must keep him shorter \u2013 otherwise he will ruin my reputation.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd once again Zarathustra shook his head and wondered. \u201cWhat am I supposed to think of that?\u201d he said once more.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy did the ghost shout: \u2018It is time! It is high time!\u2019\r\n\r\nFor what then is it \u2013 high time?\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 56}, {"data": {"uuid": "19fafeaa-5ed7-48b0-8df1-a5a644dcf567", "user": 1, "title": "The Soothsayer", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:37:15.543442+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:37:15.562650+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Soothsayer</h2><p>\u201c\u2013 and I saw a great sadness descend over humanity.

But at last something happened that awakened me.\r\n\r\nThree times there were blows at the door, like thundering, and the vaults echoed and howled three times in return; then I went to the gate.\r\n\r\n\u2018Alpa!\u2019 I cried. \u2018Who bears his ashes to the mountain? Alpa! Alpa! Who bears his ashes to the mountain?\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd I pressed the key and lifted on the gate and strained. But it would not open even the width of a finger:\r\n\r\nThen a roaring wind tore its wings apart; whistling, shrilling and whipping it threw down a black coffin before me:\r\n\r\nAnd amidst the roaring and whistling and shrilling the coffin burst open and spewed forth thousandfold laughter.\r\n\r\nAnd it laughed and mocked and roared against me from a thousand grimaces of children, angels, owls, fools and butterflies the size of children.\r\n\r\nI was horribly frightened; it threw me to the ground. And I cried out in terror as I have never cried before.\r\n\r\nBut my own cries awakened me \u2013 and I came to. \u2013\u201d\r\n\r\nThus Zarathustra related his dream and then he was silent, for he did not yet know the interpretation of his dream. But the disciple whom he loved most quickly stood up, took hold of Zarathustra\u2019s hand and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cYour life itself interprets this dream for us, oh Zarathustra!\r\n\r\nAre you yourself not the wind with its shrill whistling, that tears open the gates of the fortresses of death?\r\n\r\nAre you yourself not the coffin full of colorful sarcasms and the angelic grimaces of life?\r\n\r\nIndeed, like thousandfold children\u2019s laughter Zarathustra comes into all burial chambers, laughing at these night watchmen and grave guardians, and whoever else rattles about with dingy keys.\r\n\r\nYou will frighten and lay them low with your laughter; your power over them will be proven by their swooning and awakening.\r\n\r\nAnd even if the long twilight comes and the weariness unto death, you will not set in our sky, you advocate of life!\r\n\r\nYou allowed us to see new stars and new splendors of the night; indeed, you spanned laughter itself above us like a colorful tent.\r\n\r\nChildren\u2019s laughter will well up from coffins from now on; a strong wind will come triumphantly to all weariness unto death from now on: of this you yourself are our guarantor and soothsayer!\r\n\r\nIndeed, you yourself dreamed them, your enemies: that was your hardest dream!\r\n\r\nBut as you awakened from them and came to yourself, thus shall they awaken from themselves \u2013 and come to you!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke the disciple, and all the others now crowded around Zarathustra and took him by the hands and wanted to persuade him to abandon his bed and his sadness and to return to them. But Zarathustra sat upright on his bed and with a strange look. Like someone who returns home from long sojourns abroad, he gazed at his disciples and examined their faces; and still he did not recognize them. But as they lifted him and helped him to his feet, behold, all at once his eyes transformed; he comprehended all that had happened, stroked his beard and said in a strong voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cWell then! This has its time; but for now see to it, my disciples, that we prepare a good meal, and quickly! Thus I plan to do penance for bad dreams!\r\n\r\nBut the soothsayer shall eat and drink beside me; and truly, I will yet show him a sea in which he can drown!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra. Then, however, he gazed long into the face of the disciple who had served as the dream interpreter, and he shook his head. \u2013"}, "id": 57}, {"data": {"uuid": "03860f26-5495-4bb2-a8e5-6166af3eafb6", "user": 1, "title": "On Redemption", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:38:11.943799+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:38:11.968864+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Redemption</h2><p>As Zarathustra crossed over the great bridge one day, the cripples and the beggars surrounded him and a hunchback spoke thus to him:</p><p>\u201cBehold, Zarathustra!

An ear as big as a person!\u2019 And I looked more closely, and really, beneath the ear something was moving that was pitifully small and pathetic and thin. And, in truth, the gigantic ear sat upon a little slender stalk \u2013 but the stalk was a human being! If one used a magnifying glass one could even recognize a tiny, envious miniature face; even a bloated little soul dangling on the stalk. But the people told me that the big ear was not only a human being, but a great human being, a genius. But I have never believed the people when they speak of great human beings \u2013 and I maintained my belief that it was an inverse cripple who had too little of everything and too much of one thing.\u201d</p><p>When Zarathustra had spoken thus to the hunchback and to those for whom he had served as mouthpiece and advocate, he turned deeply upset to his disciples and said:</p><p>\u201cTruly, my friends, I walk among human beings as among the fragments and limbs of human beings!</p><p>This is what is most frightening to my eyes, that I find mankind in ruins and scattered about as if on a battle field or a butcher field.</p><p>And if my gaze flees from the now to the past; it always finds the same: fragments and limbs and grisly accidents \u2013 but no human beings!</p><p>The now and the past on earth \u2013 alas, my friends \u2013 that is what is most unbearable to me. And I would not know how to live if I were not also a seer of that which must come.</p><p>A seer, a willer, a creator, a future himself and a bridge to the future \u2013 and alas, at the same time a cripple at this bridge: all that is Zarathustra.</p><p>And you too asked yourselves often: \u2018Who is Zarathustra to us? How shall he be known to us?\u2019 And like me you gave yourselves questions for answers.</p><p>Is he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? An autumn? Or a plow? A physician? Or a convalescent?</p><p>Is he a poet? Or a truthful man? A liberator? Or a tamer? A good man? Or an evil man?</p><p>I walk among human beings as among the fragments of the future; that future that I see.</p><p>And all my creating and striving amounts to this, that I create and piece together into one, what is now fragment and riddle and grisly accident.</p><p>And how could I bear to be a human being if mankind were not also creator and solver of riddles and redeemer of accident?</p><p>To redeem those who are the past and to recreate all \u2018it was\u2019 into \u2018thus I willed it!\u2019 \u2013 only that would I call redemption!</p><p>Will \u2013 thus the liberator and joy bringer is called; thus I taught you, my friends!

Alas, the stone \u201cit was\u201d is unmoveable; all punishments too must be eternal!\u2019 Thus preached madness.</p><p>\u2018No deed can be annihilated; how could it be undone through punishment? This, this is what is eternal about the punishment called existence, that existence must also eternally be deed and guilt again!</p><p>Unless the will were to finally redeem itself and willing became not-willing \u2013 \u2019; but my brothers, you know this fable song of madness!</p><p>Away from these fable songs I steered you when I taught you: \u2018The will is a creator.\u2019</p><p>All \u2018it was\u2019 is a fragment, a riddle, a grisly accident \u2013 until the creating will says to it: \u2018But I will it thus!

And why should Zarathustra not learn also from the people, if the people learn from Zarathustra?\r\n\r\nBut it is the least thing to me, since I have been among human beings, when I see \u2018This one is missing an eye and That one an ear and the Third one a leg, and there are Others who lost their tongue or their nose or their head.\u2019\r\n\r\nI see and have seen worse, and some of it so hideous that I do not want to speak of everything, and of a few things I do not even want to remain silent; namely human beings who were missing everything except the one thing they have too much of \u2013 human beings who are nothing more than one big eye, or one big maw or one big belly or some other big thing \u2013 inverse cripples I call such types.\r\n\r\nAnd as I came out of my solitude and crossed over this bridge the first time, then I didn\u2019t believe my eyes and I looked and I looked again and said at last: \u2018That is an ear! An ear as big as a person!\u2019 And I looked more closely, and really, beneath the ear something was moving that was pitifully small and pathetic and thin. And, in truth, the gigantic ear sat upon a little slender stalk \u2013 but the stalk was a human being! If one used a magnifying glass one could even recognize a tiny, envious miniature face; even a bloated little soul dangling on the stalk. But the people told me that the big ear was not only a human being, but a great human being, a genius. But I have never believed the people when they speak of great human beings \u2013 and I maintained my belief that it was an inverse cripple who had too little of everything and too much of one thing.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen Zarathustra had spoken thus to the hunchback and to those for whom he had served as mouthpiece and advocate, he turned deeply upset to his disciples and said:\r\n\r\n\u201cTruly, my friends, I walk among human beings as among the fragments and limbs of human beings!\r\n\r\nThis is what is most frightening to my eyes, that I find mankind in ruins and scattered about as if on a battle field or a butcher field.\r\n\r\nAnd if my gaze flees from the now to the past; it always finds the same: fragments and limbs and grisly accidents \u2013 but no human beings!\r\n\r\nThe now and the past on earth \u2013 alas, my friends \u2013 that is what is most unbearable to me. And I would not know how to live if I were not also a seer of that which must come.\r\n\r\nA seer, a willer, a creator, a future himself and a bridge to the future \u2013 and alas, at the same time a cripple at this bridge: all that is Zarathustra.\r\n\r\nAnd you too asked yourselves often: \u2018Who is Zarathustra to us? How shall he be known to us?\u2019 And like me you gave yourselves questions for answers.\r\n\r\nIs he a promiser? Or a fulfiller? A conqueror? Or an inheritor? An autumn? Or a plow? A physician? Or a convalescent?\r\n\r\nIs he a poet? Or a truthful man? A liberator? Or a tamer? A good man? Or an evil man?\r\n\r\nI walk among human beings as among the fragments of the future; that future that I see.\r\n\r\nAnd all my creating and striving amounts to this, that I create and piece together into one, what is now fragment and riddle and grisly accident.\r\n\r\nAnd how could I bear to be a human being if mankind were not also creator and solver of riddles and redeemer of accident?\r\n\r\nTo redeem those who are the past and to recreate all \u2018it was\u2019 into \u2018thus I willed it!\u2019 \u2013 only that would I call redemption!\r\n\r\nWill \u2013 thus the liberator and joy bringer is called; thus I taught you, my friends! And now learn this in addition: the will itself is still a prisoner.\r\n\r\nWilling liberates, but what is that called, which claps even the liberator in chains?\r\n\r\n\u2018It was\u2019: thus is called the will\u2019s gnashing of teeth and loneliest misery. Impotent against that which has been \u2013 it is an angry spectator of everything past.\r\n\r\nThe will cannot will backward; that it cannot break time and time\u2019s greed \u2013 that is the will\u2019s loneliest misery.\r\n\r\nWilling liberates; what does willing plan in order to rid itself of its misery and mock its dungeon?\r\n\r\nAlas, every prisoner becomes a fool! Foolishly as well the imprisoned will redeems itself.\r\n\r\nThat time does not run backward, that is its wrath. \u2018That which was\u2019 \u2013 thus the stone is called, which it cannot roll aside.\r\n\r\nAnd so it rolls stones around out of wrath and annoyance, and wreaks revenge on that which does not feel wrath and annoyance as it does.\r\n\r\nThus the will, the liberator, became a doer of harm; and on everything that is capable of suffering it avenges itself for not being able to go back.\r\n\r\nThis, yes this alone is revenge itself: the will\u2019s unwillingness toward time and time\u2019s \u2018it was.\u2019\r\n\r\nIndeed, a great folly lives in our will; and it became the curse of all humankind that this folly acquired spirit!\r\n\r\nThe spirit of revenge: my friends, that so far has been what mankind contemplate best; and wherever there was suffering, punishment was always supposed to be there as well.\r\n\r\nFor \u2018punishment\u2019 is what revenge calls itself; with a lying word it hypocritically asserts its good conscience.\r\n\r\nAnd because in willing itself there is suffering, based on its inability to will backward \u2013 thus all willing itself and all living is supposed to be \u2013 punishment!\r\n\r\nAnd now cloud upon cloud rolled in over the spirit, until at last madness preached: \u2018Everything passes away, therefore everything deserves to pass away!\r\n\r\nAnd this itself is justice, this law of time that it must devour its own children\u2019 \u2013 thus preached madness.\r\n\r\n\u2018All things are ordained ethically according to justice and punishment. Alas, where is redemption from the flux of things and from the punishment called existence?\u2019 Thus preached madness.\r\n\r\n\u2018Can there be redemption, if there is eternal justice? Alas, the stone \u201cit was\u201d is unmoveable; all punishments too must be eternal!\u2019 Thus preached madness.\r\n\r\n\u2018No deed can be annihilated; how could it be undone through punishment? This, this is what is eternal about the punishment called existence, that existence must also eternally be deed and guilt again!\r\n\r\nUnless the will were to finally redeem itself and willing became not-willing \u2013 \u2019; but my brothers, you know this fable song of madness!\r\n\r\nAway from these fable songs I steered you when I taught you: \u2018The will is a creator.\u2019\r\n\r\nAll \u2018it was\u2019 is a fragment, a riddle, a grisly accident \u2013 until the creating will says to it: \u2018But I will it thus! I shall will it thus!\u2019\r\n\r\nBut has it ever spoken thus? And when will this happen? Is the will already unharnessed from its own folly?\r\n\r\nHas the will already become its own redeemer and joy bringer? Has it unlearned the spirit of revenge and all gnashing of teeth?\r\n\r\nAnd who taught it reconciliation with time, and what is higher than any reconciliation?\r\n\r\nThat will which is the will to power must will something higher than any reconciliation \u2013\r\n\r\nbut how shall this happen? Who would teach it to also will backward?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 But at this point in his speech Zarathustra suddenly broke off and looked entirely like one who is appalled in the extreme. Appalled he looked at his disciples, his eyes penetrated their thoughts and their secret thoughts as if with arrows. But after a little while he laughed again and said, more calmly:\r\n\r\n\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to live with people because keeping silent is so hard. Especially for someone who is talkative.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra. The hunchback meanwhile had listened to the conversation with his face covered, but when he heard Zarathustra laugh he looked up inquisitively and slowly said:\r\n\r\n\u201cBut why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to us than to his disciples?\u201d\r\n\r\nZarathustra answered: \u201cWhat\u2019s to wonder about in that! One is allowed to speak hunched with hunchbacks!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood,\u201d said the hunchback, \u201cand with pupils one may tell tales out of school.\r\n\r\nBut why does Zarathustra speak otherwise to his pupils \u2013 than to himself?\u201d \u2013"}, "id": 58}, {"data": {"uuid": "93f5776b-5c0c-46cf-9717-bbd69a65bf41", "user": 1, "title": "On Human Prudence", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:39:08.507474+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:39:08.523856+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Human Prudence</h2><p>Not the height: the precipice is what is terrible!</p><p>The precipice, where one\u2019s gaze plunges downward and one\u2019s hand grasps upward.

At that location there was safe harborage where even foreign ships liked to anchor; these would take the occasional passenger who wanted to cross the sea from the blessed isles. Now as Zarathustra climbed up the mountain he thought as he traveled about his many lonely wanderings since the time of his youth, and about how many mountains and ridges and peaks he had already climbed.</p><p>I am a wanderer and a mountain climber, he said to his heart. I do not like the plains and it seems I cannot sit still for long.</p><p>And whatever may come to me now as destiny and experience \u2013 it will involve wandering and mountain climbing: ultimately one experiences only oneself.</p><p>The time has passed in which accidents could still befall me, and what could fall to me now that is not already my own?</p><p>It merely returns, it finally comes home to me \u2013 my own self and everything in it that has long been abroad and scattered among all things and accidents.</p><p>And I know one more thing: I am standing now before my last peak and before what has been saved for me for the longest time. Indeed, I must start my hardest path! Indeed, I have begun my loneliest hike!</p><p>But whoever is of my kind does not escape such an hour, the hour that speaks to him: \u201cOnly now do you go your way of greatness! Peak and abyss \u2013 they are now merged as one!</p><p>You go your way of greatness; now what was formerly your ultimate danger has become your ultimate refuge!</p><p>You go your way of greatness; now it must be your best courage that there is no longer a way behind you!</p><p>You go your way of greatness; here no one shall sneak along after you! Your foot itself erased the path behind you, and above it stands written: impossibility.</p><p>And if now all ladders should fail, then you must know how to climb on your own head \u2013 how else would you climb upward?</p><p>On your own head and over and beyond your own heart! Now what is mildest in you must become hardest.</p><p>Whoever has always spared himself much gets sick in the end from so much coddling. Praised be whatever makes hard! I do not praise the land where butter and honey flow!</p><p>It is necessary to look away from oneself in order to see much: this hardness is needed by every mountain climber.</p><p>But whoever is importunate with his eyes as a seeker of knowledge \u2013 how could he see more of things than their foregrounds?</p><p>But you, Zarathustra, you wanted to see the ground and background of all things, and so you must climb over yourself \u2013 up, upward, until you have even your stars beneath you!\u201d</p><p>Yes, look down on myself and even on my stars: only that would I call my peak, that remains to me as my ultimate peak! \u2013</p><p>Thus Zarathustra spoke to himself as he climbed, comforting his heart with hard sayings, for he was sore in his heart as never before. And as he came to the top of the mountain ridge, behold, there lay the other sea stretching before him, and he stood still and silent for a long time. But at this altitude the night was cold and clear and bright with stars.</p><p>I recognize my lot, he said at last, with sorrow. Well then! I am ready. Just now my ultimate solitude began.</p><p>Oh this black sad sea beneath me! Oh this pregnant nocturnal moroseness! Oh destiny and sea \u2013 now I must descend to you!</p><p>I stand before my highest mountains and before my longest hike: therefore I must descend deeper than I ever climbed before:</p><p>\u2013 descend deeper into suffering than I ever climbed before, down into its blackest flood! My destiny wills it so: Well then! I am ready.</p><p>Where did the highest mountains come from? Thus I once asked. Then I learned that they come from the sea.</p><p>This testimony is written into their stone and onto the walls of their peaks.

But Zarathustra kept silent for two days and was cold and deaf with sadness, such that he answered neither to glances nor questions. On the evening of the second day, however, he opened his ears again, even though he continued to be silent; for there was much that was peculiar and dangerous to be heard on this ship, which had come from far away and wanted to go still farther. But Zarathustra was a friend of all who make distant journeys and do not like to live without danger, and so, finally, his own tongue was freed while listening, and the ice of his heart broke: then he began to speak thus:</p><p>To you, bold searchers, researchers, and whoever put to terrible seas with cunning sails \u2013</p><p>to you, the riddle-drunk, the twilight-happy whose souls are lured by flutes to every maelstrom:</p><p>\u2013 because you do not want to probe along a thread with cowardly hands; and because where you can guess, there you hate to deduce \u2013</p><p>to you alone I tell the riddle that I saw \u2013 the vision of the loneliest one. \u2013</p><p>Darkly I walked recently through cadaver-colored twilight \u2013 darkly and hard, biting my lip. Not only one sun had set for me.</p><p>A path that climbed defiantly through boulders, a malicious, lonely path consoled neither by weed nor shrub \u2013 a mountain path crunched under the defiance of my foot.</p><p>Striding mutely over the mocking clatter of pebbles, crushing the rock that caused it to slip; thus my foot forced its way upward.</p><p>Upward \u2013 in defiance of the spirit that pulled it downward, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch-enemy.</p><p>Upward \u2013 even though he sat atop me, half dwarf, half mole, lame, paralyzing, dripping lead into my ear, lead-drop thoughts into my brain.</p><p>\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d he murmured scornfully, syllable by syllable. \u201cYou stone of wisdom! You hurled yourself high, but every hurled stone must \u2013 fall!</p><p>Oh Zarathustra, you stone of wisdom, you sling stone, you star crusher! You hurled yourself so high \u2013 but every hurled stone \u2013 must fall!</p><p>Sentenced to yourself and to your own stoning; oh Zarathustra, far indeed you hurled the stone \u2013 but it will fall back down upon you!\u201d</p><p>Then the dwarf became silent, and that lasted a long time. But his silence oppressed me, and being at two in such a way truly makes one lonelier than being at one!</p><p>I climbed, I climbed, I dreamed, I thought \u2013 but everything oppressed me. I resembled a sick person whose severe agonies make him weary, and who is then jarred out of falling asleep by an even worse dream. \u2013</p><p>But there is something in me that I call courage: this so far has slain my every discourage. This courage at last commanded me to stand still and to say: \u201cDwarf \u2013 you or I!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Courage after all is the best slayer \u2013 courage that attacks; for in every attack there is sounding brass.</p><p>But the human being is the most courageous animal, and so it overcame every animal. With sounding brass it even overcame every pain, but human pain is the deepest pain.</p><p>Courage also slays dizziness at the abyss; and where do human beings not stand at the abyss? Is seeing itself not \u2013 seeing the abyss?</p><p>Courage is the best slayer; courage slays even pity. But pity is the deepest abyss, and as deeply as human beings look into life, so deeply too they look into suffering.</p><p>But courage is the best slayer, courage that attacks; it slays even death, for it says: \u201cWas that life? Well then! One More Time!\u201d</p><p>In such a saying, however, there is much sounding brass. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</p><h3>2</h3><p>\u201cStop, dwarf!\u201d I said. \u201cI \u2013 or you! But I am the stronger of us two \u2013 you do not know my abysmal thought! That \u2013 you could not bear!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Then something happened that made me lighter, for the dwarf jumped down from my shoulder, the inquisitive one, and he crouched upon a stone there before me. But right there where we stopped was a gateway.</p><p>\u201cSee this gateway, dwarf!\u201d I continued. \u201cIt has two faces. Two paths come together here; no one has yet walked them to the end.</p><p>This long lane back: it lasts an eternity. And that long lane outward \u2013 that is another eternity.</p><p>They contradict each other, these paths; they blatantly offend each other \u2013 and here at this gateway is where they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed at the top: \u2018Moment.\u2019</p><p>But whoever were to walk one of them further \u2013 and ever further and ever on: do you believe, dwarf, that these paths contradict each other eternally?\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u201cAll that is straight lies,\u201d murmured the dwarf contemptuously. \u201cAll truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou spirit of gravity!\u201d I said, angrily. \u201cDo not make it too easy on yourself! Or I shall leave you crouching here where you crouch, lamefoot \u2013 and I bore you this high!</p><p>See this moment!\u201d I continued. \u201cFrom this gateway Moment a long eternal lane stretches backward: behind us lies an eternity.</p><p>Must not whatever can already have passed this way before? Must not whatever can happen, already have happened, been done, passed by before?</p><p>And if everything has already been here before, what do you think of this moment, dwarf? Must this gateway too not already \u2013 have been here?</p><p>And are not all things firmly knotted together in such a way that this moment draws after it all things to come? Therefore \u2013 itself as well?</p><p>For, whatever can run, even in this long lane outward \u2013 must run it once more! \u2013</p><p>And this slow spider that creeps in the moonlight, and this moonlight itself, and I and you in the gateway whispering together, whispering of eternal things \u2013 must not all of us have been here before?</p><p>\u2013 And return and run in that other lane, outward, before us, in this long, eerie lane \u2013 must we not return eternally? \u2013\u201d</p><p>Thus I spoke, softer and softer, for I was afraid of my own thought and secret thoughts. Then, suddenly, I heard a dog howl nearby.</p><p>Had I ever heard a dog howl like this? My thoughts raced back. Yes! When I was a child, in my most distant childhood:</p><p>\u2013 then I heard a dog howl like this. And I saw it too, bristling, its head up, trembling in the stillest midnight when even dogs believe in ghosts:</p><p>\u2013 so that I felt pity. For the full moon had passed over the house, silent as death, and it had just stopped, a round smolder \u2013 stopped on the flat roof just as if on a stranger\u2019s property \u2013</p><p>that is the why the dog was so horror-stricken, because dogs believe in thieves and ghosts. And when I heard it howl like this again, I felt pity once more.</p><p>Where now was the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the whispering? Was I dreaming? Was I waking? I stood all of a sudden among wild cliffs, alone, desolate, in the most desolate moonlight.</p><p>But there lay a human being! And there! The dog jumping, bristling, whining \u2013 now it saw me coming \u2013 then it howled again, it screamed: had I ever heard a dog scream like this for help?</p><p>And truly, I saw something the like of which I had never seen before. A young shepherd I saw; writhing, choking, twitching, his face distorted, with a thick black snake hanging from his mouth.</p><p>Had I ever seen so much nausea and pale dread in one face? Surely he must have fallen asleep? Then the snake crawled into his throat \u2013 where it bit down firmly.</p><p>My hand tore at the snake and tore \u2013 in vain! It could not tear the snake from his throat. Then it cried out of me: \u201cBite down! Bite down!</p><p>Bite off the head! Bite down!\u201d \u2013 Thus it cried out of me, my dread, my hatred, my nausea, my pity, all my good and bad cried out of me with one shout. \u2013</p><p>You bold ones around me! You searchers, researchers and whoever among you ever shipped out with cunning sails onto unexplored seas! You riddle-happy ones!</p><p>Now guess me this riddle that I saw back then, now interpret me this vision of the loneliest one!</p><p>For it was a vision and a foreseeing: what did I see then as a parable? And who is it that must some day come?</p><p>Who is the shepherd into whose throat the snake crawled this way? Who is the human being into whose throat everything that is heaviest, blackest will crawl?</p><p>\u2013 Meanwhile the shepherd bit down as my shout advised him; he bit with a good bite! Far away he spat the head of the snake \u2013 and he leaped to his feet. \u2013</p><p>No longer shepherd, no longer human \u2013 a transformed, illuminated, laughing being!</p><p>Never yet on earth had I heard a human being laugh as he laughed!</p><p>Oh my brothers, I heard a laughter that was no human laughter \u2013 and now a thirst gnaws at me, a longing that will never be still.</p><p>My longing for this laughter gnaws at me; oh how can I bear to go on living! And how could I bear to die now! \u2013</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra.</p>", "article_json": {"type": "doc", "content": [{"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 2}, "content": [{"text": "On the Vision and the Riddle", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 3}, "content": [{"text": "1", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"text": "When it was rumored among the sailors that Zarathustra was on the ship \u2013 for a man who came from the blessed isles went on board at the same time as him \u2013 then a great curiosity and anticipation arose.

But Zarathustra kept silent for two days and was cold and deaf with sadness, such that he answered neither to glances nor questions. On the evening of the second day, however, he opened his ears again, even though he continued to be silent; for there was much that was peculiar and dangerous to be heard on this ship, which had come from far away and wanted to go still farther. But Zarathustra was a friend of all who make distant journeys and do not like to live without danger, and so, finally, his own tongue was freed while listening, and the ice of his heart broke: then he began to speak thus:\r\n\r\nTo you, bold searchers, researchers, and whoever put to terrible seas with cunning sails \u2013\r\n\r\nto you, the riddle-drunk, the twilight-happy whose souls are lured by flutes to every maelstrom:\r\n\r\n\u2013 because you do not want to probe along a thread with cowardly hands; and because where you can guess, there you hate to deduce \u2013\r\n\r\nto you alone I tell the riddle that I saw \u2013 the vision of the loneliest one. \u2013\r\n\r\nDarkly I walked recently through cadaver-colored twilight \u2013 darkly and hard, biting my lip. Not only one sun had set for me.\r\n\r\nA path that climbed defiantly through boulders, a malicious, lonely path consoled neither by weed nor shrub \u2013 a mountain path crunched under the defiance of my foot.\r\n\r\nStriding mutely over the mocking clatter of pebbles, crushing the rock that caused it to slip; thus my foot forced its way upward.\r\n\r\nUpward \u2013 in defiance of the spirit that pulled it downward, the spirit of gravity, my devil and arch-enemy.\r\n\r\nUpward \u2013 even though he sat atop me, half dwarf, half mole, lame, paralyzing, dripping lead into my ear, lead-drop thoughts into my brain.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d he murmured scornfully, syllable by syllable. \u201cYou stone of wisdom! You hurled yourself high, but every hurled stone must \u2013 fall!\r\n\r\nOh Zarathustra, you stone of wisdom, you sling stone, you star crusher! You hurled yourself so high \u2013 but every hurled stone \u2013 must fall!\r\n\r\nSentenced to yourself and to your own stoning; oh Zarathustra, far indeed you hurled the stone \u2013 but it will fall back down upon you!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the dwarf became silent, and that lasted a long time. But his silence oppressed me, and being at two in such a way truly makes one lonelier than being at one!\r\n\r\nI climbed, I climbed, I dreamed, I thought \u2013 but everything oppressed me. I resembled a sick person whose severe agonies make him weary, and who is then jarred out of falling asleep by an even worse dream. \u2013\r\n\r\nBut there is something in me that I call courage: this so far has slain my every discourage. This courage at last commanded me to stand still and to say: \u201cDwarf \u2013 you or I!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nCourage after all is the best slayer \u2013 courage that attacks; for in every attack there is sounding brass.\r\n\r\nBut the human being is the most courageous animal, and so it overcame every animal. With sounding brass it even overcame every pain, but human pain is the deepest pain.\r\n\r\nCourage also slays dizziness at the abyss; and where do human beings not stand at the abyss? Is seeing itself not \u2013 seeing the abyss?\r\n\r\nCourage is the best slayer; courage slays even pity. But pity is the deepest abyss, and as deeply as human beings look into life, so deeply too they look into suffering.\r\n\r\nBut courage is the best slayer, courage that attacks; it slays even death, for it says: \u201cWas that life? Well then! One More Time!\u201d\r\n\r\nIn such a saying, however, there is much sounding brass. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\u201cStop, dwarf!\u201d I said. \u201cI \u2013 or you! But I am the stronger of us two \u2013 you do not know my abysmal thought! That \u2013 you could not bear!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThen something happened that made me lighter, for the dwarf jumped down from my shoulder, the inquisitive one, and he crouched upon a stone there before me. But right there where we stopped was a gateway.\r\n\r\n\u201cSee this gateway, dwarf!\u201d I continued. \u201cIt has two faces. Two paths come together here; no one has yet walked them to the end.\r\n\r\nThis long lane back: it lasts an eternity. And that long lane outward \u2013 that is another eternity.\r\n\r\nThey contradict each other, these paths; they blatantly offend each other \u2013 and here at this gateway is where they come together. The name of the gateway is inscribed at the top: \u2018Moment.\u2019\r\n\r\nBut whoever were to walk one of them further \u2013 and ever further and ever on: do you believe, dwarf, that these paths contradict each other eternally?\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cAll that is straight lies,\u201d murmured the dwarf contemptuously. \u201cAll truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou spirit of gravity!\u201d I said, angrily. \u201cDo not make it too easy on yourself! Or I shall leave you crouching here where you crouch, lamefoot \u2013 and I bore you this high!\r\n\r\nSee this moment!\u201d I continued. \u201cFrom this gateway Moment a long eternal lane stretches backward: behind us lies an eternity.\r\n\r\nMust not whatever can already have passed this way before? Must not whatever can happen, already have happened, been done, passed by before?\r\n\r\nAnd if everything has already been here before, what do you think of this moment, dwarf? Must this gateway too not already \u2013 have been here?\r\n\r\nAnd are not all things firmly knotted together in such a way that this moment draws after it all things to come? Therefore \u2013 itself as well?\r\n\r\nFor, whatever can run, even in this long lane outward \u2013 must run it once more! \u2013\r\n\r\nAnd this slow spider that creeps in the moonlight, and this moonlight itself, and I and you in the gateway whispering together, whispering of eternal things \u2013 must not all of us have been here before?\r\n\r\n\u2013 And return and run in that other lane, outward, before us, in this long, eerie lane \u2013 must we not return eternally? \u2013\u201d\r\n\r\nThus I spoke, softer and softer, for I was afraid of my own thought and secret thoughts. Then, suddenly, I heard a dog howl nearby.\r\n\r\nHad I ever heard a dog howl like this? My thoughts raced back. Yes! When I was a child, in my most distant childhood:\r\n\r\n\u2013 then I heard a dog howl like this. And I saw it too, bristling, its head up, trembling in the stillest midnight when even dogs believe in ghosts:\r\n\r\n\u2013 so that I felt pity. For the full moon had passed over the house, silent as death, and it had just stopped, a round smolder \u2013 stopped on the flat roof just as if on a stranger\u2019s property \u2013\r\n\r\nthat is the why the dog was so horror-stricken, because dogs believe in thieves and ghosts. And when I heard it howl like this again, I felt pity once more.\r\n\r\nWhere now was the dwarf? And the gateway? And the spider? And all the whispering? Was I dreaming? Was I waking? I stood all of a sudden among wild cliffs, alone, desolate, in the most desolate moonlight.\r\n\r\nBut there lay a human being! And there! The dog jumping, bristling, whining \u2013 now it saw me coming \u2013 then it howled again, it screamed: had I ever heard a dog scream like this for help?\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I saw something the like of which I had never seen before. A young shepherd I saw; writhing, choking, twitching, his face distorted, with a thick black snake hanging from his mouth.\r\n\r\nHad I ever seen so much nausea and pale dread in one face? Surely he must have fallen asleep? Then the snake crawled into his throat \u2013 where it bit down firmly.\r\n\r\nMy hand tore at the snake and tore \u2013 in vain! It could not tear the snake from his throat. Then it cried out of me: \u201cBite down! Bite down!\r\n\r\nBite off the head! Bite down!\u201d \u2013 Thus it cried out of me, my dread, my hatred, my nausea, my pity, all my good and bad cried out of me with one shout. \u2013\r\n\r\nYou bold ones around me!

But when he was four days removed from the blessed isles and from his friends, he had overcome all of his pain: triumphant and with firm footing he stood once again upon his destiny. And then Zarathustra spoke thus to his jubilating conscience:</p><p>I am alone again and want to be, alone with pure sky and open sea; and again it is afternoon around me.</p><p>In the afternoon I once found my friends for the first time, in the afternoon then a second time: at the hour when all light grows stiller.</p><p>For whatever happiness is still underway between sky and earth, it now seeks shelter for itself in a bright soul: out of happiness now all light has become stiller.</p><p>Oh afternoon of my life! Once my happiness too climbed to the valley to seek itself a shelter; there it found these open, hospitable souls.</p><p>Oh afternoon of my life! What have I not given up to have this one thing: this lively plantation of my thoughts and this morning light of my highest hope!</p><p>Companions the creator once sought and children of his hope, and truly, it turned out that he could not find them unless he first created them himself.</p><p>And so I am in the middle of my work, going to my children and returning from them; for the sake of his children Zarathustra must complete himself.</p><p>For at bottom one loves only one\u2019s own child and work; and where there is great love for oneself it is the hallmark of pregnancy \u2013 this is what I found.</p><p>My children are still greening in their first spring, standing close to one another and shaken by a common wind, the trees of my garden and best plot of soil.</p><p>And truly, where such trees stand next to one another, there are blessed isles!</p><p>But at some point I want to dig them up and set each one apart, so that it learns solitude and defiance and caution.</p><p>Gnarled and crooked and with pliant hardness it shall stand then beside the sea, a living lighthouse of invincible life.</p><p>There, where the storms plunge down into the sea and the mountain\u2019s trunk drinks water, there each one shall someday have his day and night watches, for his own testing and knowledge.</p><p>He shall be known and tested as to whether he is of my kind and kin \u2013 whether he is the master of a long will, taciturn even when he speaks, and yielding in such a way that he takes in giving \u2013</p><p>\u2013 so that he might one day become my companion and a fellow creator and fellow celebrator of Zarathustra: the kind who writes my will on my tablets for the fuller completion of all things.</p><p>And for his sake and his kind I must complete myself; therefore I now avoid my happiness and offer myself to all unhappiness \u2013 for my ultimate testing and knowledge.</p><p>And truly, it was time that I left, and the wanderer\u2019s shadow and the bitterest boredom and the stillest hour \u2013 all of them said to me: \u201cit is high time!\u201d</p><p>The wind blew through my keyhole and said: \u201ccome!\u201d The door sprang open slyly and said: \u201cgo!\u201d</p><p>But I lay chained to the love of my children; desire set this snare for me, desire for love, that I might become the prey of my children and lose myself to them.</p><p>Desire \u2013 to me that means: to have lost myself. I have you, my children! In this having, everything shall be certain and nothing shall be desire.</p><p>But the sun lay brooding on my love, and Zarathustra cooked in his own juice \u2013 then shadows and doubts flew over and past me.</p><p>I craved frost and winter: \u201cOh if only frost and winter made me snap and crunch again!\u201d I sighed \u2013 then icy fog rose up out of me.</p><p>My past broke open its graves; many a pain that had been buried alive awakened \u2013 it had merely had a good night\u2019s sleep, hidden in burial shrouds.</p><p>Thus everything cried out to me in signs: \u201cit is time!\u201d \u2013 But I \u2013 did not hear.

As yet I have not been strong enough for the lion\u2019s final overreaching and cheeky mischief.</p><p>Your gravity alone was always terrible enough for me; but one day I shall yet find the strength and the lion\u2019s voice to summon you up!</p><p>When I have once overcome that challenge, then I want to overcome one still greater; and a triumph shall be the seal of my completion! \u2013</p><p>Meanwhile I still drift on uncertain seas; accident flatters me with its smooth tongue, and though I look forward and backward, I still see no end.</p><p>As yet the hour of my final struggle has not come \u2013 or does it come just now? Indeed, with treacherous beauty the surrounding sea and life gaze at me!</p><p>Oh afternoon of my life! Oh happiness before evening! Oh harbor on the high sea! Oh peace in uncertainty! How I mistrust you all!</p><p>Indeed, I am mistrustful of your treacherous beauty! I resemble the lover who mistrusts the all too velvety smile.</p><p>As he pushes his most beloved before him, tender even in his hardness, the jealous one \u2013 so too I push this blissful hour before me.</p><p>Away with you, you blissful hour!

You abyss of light! Gazing at you I shudder with godlike desires.\r\n\r\nTo hurl myself into your height \u2013 that is my depth! To hide myself in your purity \u2013 that is my innocence.\r\n\r\nThe god is veiled by his beauty; thus you conceal your stars. You do not speak; thus you make your wisdom known to me.\r\n\r\nMutely you rose for me today over the roaring sea, your love and your modesty speak revelation to my roaring soul.\r\n\r\nThat you came to me beautiful, veiled in your beauty; that you speak to me mutely, revealed in your wisdom \u2013\r\n\r\noh how could I not guess all that is modesty in your soul! Before the sun you came to me, the loneliest one.\r\n\r\nWe are friends from the beginning; we have grief and ghastliness and ground in common; even the sun we have in common.\r\n\r\nWe do not speak to one another because we know too much: we are silent to one another, we smile our knowledge to one another.\r\n\r\nAre you not the light to my fire? Do you not have the sister soul to my insight?\r\n\r\nTogether we learned everything; together we learned to climb up to ourselves by climbing over ourselves, and to smile cloudlessly:\r\n\r\n\u2013 smile down cloudlessly from bright eyes and from a distance of miles, when beneath us pressure and purpose and guilt steam like rain.\r\n\r\nAnd if I wandered alone \u2013 for whom did my soul thirst in nights and on wrong paths? And if I climbed mountains, whom did I ever seek if not you on mountains?\r\n\r\nAnd all my wandering and mountain climbing: they were only a necessity and a help to the helpless one \u2013 the only thing my will wants is to fly, to fly into you!\r\n\r\nAnd whom did I hate more than drifting clouds and everything that stains you? And I hated even my own hatred because it stained you!\r\n\r\nI grudge these drifting clouds, these creeping predator-cats; they take from you and me what we have in common \u2013 our awesome infinite saying of Yes and Amen.\r\n\r\nWe grudge these middle-men and mixers, these drifting clouds, these half-and-halfs who learned neither to bless, nor to curse whole heartedly.\r\n\r\nI would rather sit in a barrel under a closed sky, would rather sit in an abyss without sky than see you, sky of light, stained by drifting clouds!\r\n\r\nAnd often I wanted to tie them together with the jagged gold wires of lightning, and beat their kettle bellies like thunder \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 an angry kettle drummer because they rob me of your Yes! and Amen! \u2013 you sky above me, you pure, you bright one! You abyss of light! \u2013 Because they rob you of my Yes! and Amen!\r\n\r\nFor I would rather have din and thunder and stormy cursing than this deliberate, dubious cat calm; and even among humans the ones I hate most are the soft steppers and half-and-halfs and dubious, dawdling drift-clouds.\r\n\r\nAnd \u201cwhoever cannot bless, let him learn to curse!\u201d \u2013 this bright teaching fell to me from the bright sky, this star stands in my sky even in black nights.\r\n\r\nI am a blesser and a Yes-sayer if only you are around me, you pure, you bright one, you abyss of light! Into all abysses then I carry my Yes-saying that blesses.\r\n\r\nI have become a blesser and a Yes-sayer, and for this I wrestled long and was a wrestler, in order to free my hands one day for blessing.\r\n\r\nBut this is my blessing: to stand over each thing as its own sky, as its round roof, its azure bell and eternal security \u2013 and blessed is he who blesses so!\r\n\r\nFor all things are baptized at the well of eternity and beyond good and evil; good and evil themselves, however, are only shadows in between and damp glooms and drift-clouds.\r\n\r\nTruly it is a blessing and no blasphemy when I teach: \u201cOver all things stands the sky accident, the sky innocence, the sky chance, the sky mischief.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBy chance\u201d \u2013 that is the oldest nobility in the world, I gave it back to all things, I redeemed them from their servitude under purpose.\r\n\r\nThis freedom and cheerfulness of the sky I placed like an azure bell over all things when I taught that over them and through them no \u201ceternal will\u201d \u2013 wills.\r\n\r\nThis mischief and this folly I placed in place of that will when I taught: \u201cWith all things one thing is impossible \u2013 rationality!\u201d\r\n\r\nA bit of reason to be sure, a seed of wisdom sprinkled from star to star \u2013 this sourdough is mixed into all things: for the sake of folly, wisdom is mixed into all things!\r\n\r\nA bit of wisdom is indeed possible; but I found this blessed certainty in all things: that on the feet of accident they would rather \u2013 dance.\r\n\r\nOh sky above me, you pure, you exalted one! This your purity is to me now, that there is no eternal spider and spider web of reason:\r\n\r\n\u2013 that you are my dance floor for divine accident, that you are my gods\u2019 table for divine dice throws and dice players! \u2013\r\n\r\nBut you blush? Did I speak the unspeakable? Did I blaspheme when I wanted to bless you?\r\n\r\nOr is it the shame of us two that made you blush? \u2013 Do you command me to go and be silent because now \u2013 the day is coming?\r\n\r\nThe world is deep \u2013 and deeper than the day has ever grasped. Not everything may be permitted to speak before day. But the day is coming, and so let us part now!\r\n\r\nOh sky above me, you bashful, you glowing one! Oh you my happiness before sunrise! The day is coming, and so let us part now! \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 65}, {"data": {"uuid": "3837d3a7-6215-4477-8508-9aadb204faa9", "user": 1, "title": "On Virtue that Makes Small", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:49:29.183075+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:49:29.204204+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Virtue that Makes Small</h2><h3>1</h3><p>When Zarathustra was on dry land again he did not go directly to his mountains and his cave, but instead took many ways and asked many questions and found out about this and that, saying of himself jokingly: \u201cLook at the river that flows back to its source in many windings!\u201d For he wanted to learn what had transpired in the meantime among human beings; whether they had become bigger or smaller.

And once he saw a row of new houses, and he was amazed then and he said:\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat do these houses mean? Truly, no great soul placed them here, as a parable of itself!\r\n\r\nProbably some feeble-minded child took them out of its toy box? If only another child would put them back into its toy box!\r\n\r\nAnd these parlors and chambers; can men go in and out here? To me they seem made for satin dolls, or for nibblers who probably let themselves be nibbled.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd Zarathustra stood still and reflected. At last he said sadly: \u201cEverything has become smaller!\r\n\r\nEverywhere I see lower gateways; whoever is like me can still pass through, but \u2013 he has to stoop!\r\n\r\nOh when will I return to my homeland where I no longer have to stoop \u2013 no longer have to stoop before the small ones!\u201d \u2013 And Zarathustra sighed and gazed into the distance. \u2013\r\n\r\nOn the same day, however, he delivered his speech on virtue that makes small.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nI walk among these people and keep my eyes open; they do not forgive me that I am not envious of their virtues.\r\n\r\nThey bite at me because I say to them: for small people small virtues are necessary \u2013 and because I find it hard to grasp that small people are necessary!\r\n\r\nI still resemble the rooster here in a strange barnyard, whom even the hens bite; and yet I am not bad to the hens because of that.\r\n\r\nI am courteous toward them as toward all small annoyances; to be prickly toward what is small strikes me as wisdom for porcupines.\r\n\r\nThey all talk about me when they sit around the fire evenings \u2013 they talk about me, but no one thinks \u2013 about me!\r\n\r\nThis is the new stillness that I learned: their noise concerning me spreads a cloak over my thoughts.\r\n\r\nThey make noise among themselves: \u201cWhat does this dark cloud want with us? Let\u2019s see to it that it does not bring us a plague!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd recently a woman snatched her child to herself, who wanted to come to me: \u201cTake the children away!\u201d she shouted. \u201cSuch eyes singe children\u2019s souls.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey cough when I speak, they think that coughing is an objection to strong wind \u2013 they guess nothing of the roaring of my happiness! \u201cWe still have no time for Zarathustra\u201d \u2013 thus they object; but what\r\n\r\ndoes any time matter which \u201chas no time\u201d for Zarathustra? And even if they were to praise me, how could I fall asleep on their\r\n\r\npraise? Their praise is a belt of thorns to me; it scratches me even when I take it off.\r\n\r\nAnd this also I learned among them: the one who praises pretends that he is giving back, but in truth he wants to be given even more!\r\n\r\nAsk my foot whether it likes their tune of praise and palaver! Indeed, to such a beat and tick-tock it wants neither to dance nor to stand still.\r\n\r\nThey want to palaver and praise me to their small virtue; they would like to persuade my foot to the tick-tock of their small happiness.\r\n\r\nI walk among these people and keep my eyes open; they have become smaller and are becoming ever smaller: but this is because of their teaching on happiness and virtue.\r\n\r\nFor they are modest even in their virtue \u2013 because they want contentment. But only modest virtue goes along with contentment.\r\n\r\nEven they, of course, learn to stride and to stride forward in their way \u2013 this is what I call their hobbling. This way they become an obstacle to anyone who is in a hurry.\r\n\r\nAnd some of them look backward stiff-necked while walking forward; these I like to run into.\r\n\r\nFoot and eye should not lie, nor rub each other\u2019s faces in their lies. But there is much lying among the small people.\r\n\r\nA few of them will, but most of them are merely willed. A few of them are genuine, but most of them are bad actors.\r\n\r\nThere are unknowing actors among them and unwilling actors among them \u2013 the genuine are always rare, especially the genuine actors.\r\n\r\nThere is little here of the man, therefore their women masculinize themselves. For only he who is man enough will redeem the woman in woman.\r\n\r\nAnd this hypocrisy I found to be the worst among them; that even those who command feign the virtues of those who serve.\r\n\r\n\u201cI serve, you serve, we serve\u201d \u2013 this is how even the hypocrisy of the rulers prays here \u2013 and watch out if the first lord is only the first servant!\r\n\r\nOh, into their hypocrisies too the curiosity of my eyes flew astray, and well did I guess all their fly-happiness and their buzzing around sunny windowpanes.\r\n\r\nSo much kindness, so much weakness I see. So much justice and pity, so much weakness.\r\n\r\nRound, righteous and kind they are to one another, like grains of sand are round, righteous and kind to one another.\r\n\r\nTo modestly embrace a small happiness \u2013 that they call \u201cresignation\u201d and already they are squinting around modestly for a new small happiness.\r\n\r\nAt bottom these simple ones want one simple thing: that no one harm them. And so they beat everyone to it by doing them a good deed.\r\n\r\nBut this is cowardice, even if it is called \u201cvirtue.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nAnd if they ever speak gruffly, these small people, I hear only their hoarseness \u2013 for every puff of wind makes them hoarse.\r\n\r\nThey are clever, and their virtues have clever fingers. But they lack fists; their fingers do not know how to form into fists.\r\n\r\nTo them virtue is whatever makes modest and tame; this is how they made the wolf into a dog and mankind himself into mankind\u2019s favorite pet.\r\n\r\n\u201cWe place our chair in the middle\u201d \u2013 that is what their grinning says to me \u2013 \u201cand just as far away from dying fighters as from contented sows.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut this is \u2013 mediocrity: even if it is called moderation. \u2013\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nI walk among these people and let many a word fall, but they know neither to take nor to keep.\r\n\r\nThey are amazed that I did not come to lambast lusting and malignancy, and truly, nor did I come to warn of pick-pockets!\r\n\r\nThey are amazed that I am not prepared to make their cleverness wittier and prettier, as if they did not have enough cleverlings already, whose voices scrape me like chalk on slate!\r\n\r\nAnd when I shout: \u201cA curse on all cowardly devils in you, who like to whine and fold their hands and worship,\u201d then they shout: \u201cZarathustra is godless.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd especially their teachers of resignation shout it \u2013 but they are precisely the ones into whose ears I like to shout: \u201cYes! I am Zarathustra, the godless one!\u201d\r\n\r\nThese teachers of resignation! Wherever there is pettiness and sickness and scabs, they crawl to it like lice; and only my disgust prevents me from cracking them.\r\n\r\nWell then! This is my sermon for their ears: I am Zarathustra, the godless, who says: \u201cWho is more godless than I, so that I can enjoy his instruction?\u201d\r\n\r\nI am Zarathustra, the godless: where do I find my equal? And all those are my equal who give themselves their own will and put aside all resig- nation.\r\n\r\nI am Zarathustra, the godless: I still cook every chance in my pot. And only when it has been well cooked in there do I welcome it as my food.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, many a chance came to me imperiously, but my will spoke to it even more imperiously \u2013 and already it lay begging on its knees \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 begging me for protection and affection and addressing me with flattery: \u201cLook, oh Zarathustra, it\u2019s only a friend coming to a friend!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nBut why do I speak where no one has my ears! And so I want to shout it out to the four winds:\r\n\r\nYou are becoming smaller and smaller, you small people! You are crumbling, you contented ones! You will yet perish \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 of your many small virtues, of your many small abstentions, of your many small resignations!\r\n\r\nToo sparing, too yielding \u2013 that is your soil! But in order for a tree to grow tall, it needs to put down hard roots amid hard rock!\r\n\r\nAnd even what you abstain from weaves at the web of all future humanity; even your nothing is a spider web and a spider that lives off the blood of the future.\r\n\r\nAnd when you take, it\u2019s like stealing, you small-virtued ones; and even among rogues honor says: \u201cOne should only steal where one can not rob.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt will give\u201d \u2013 that too is a teaching of resignation. But I say to you contented people: it will take and it will take more and more from you!\r\n\r\nOh if only you would put aside all half willing and become as resolute in your sloth as in your deeds!\r\n\r\nOh if only you understood my words: \u201cGo ahead and do whatever you will \u2013 but first be the kind of people who can will!\r\n\r\nGo ahead and love your neighbors as you love yourselves \u2013 but first be the kind of people who love themselves \u2013\r\n\r\nlove with the great love, love with the great contempt!\u201d Thus speaks Zarathustra the godless. \u2013\r\n\r\nBut why do I speak where no one has my ears! Here it is still one hour too early for me.\r\n\r\nI am my own forerunner among these people, my own cock-crow through dark lanes.\r\n\r\nBut their hour is coming! And mine will come too! By the hour they become smaller, poorer, more sterile \u2013 poor weeds! Poor soil!\r\n\r\nAnd soon they shall stand there before me like parched grass and steppe, and truly, weary of themselves \u2013 and yearning for fire more than for water!\r\n\r\nOh blessed hour of lightning! Oh secret before noon! \u2013 Wild fires I want to make of them some day and heralds with tongues of fire \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 some day they shall proclaim with tongues of fire: It is coming, it is near, the great noon!\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 66}, {"data": {"uuid": "9fa4382f-791c-44bf-b95b-f6bbaed47c51", "user": 1, "title": "On the Mount of Olives", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:50:18.569405+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:50:18.590200+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On the Mount of Olives</h2><p>The winter, a wicked guest, sits in my house; my hands are blue from his friendly handshake.</p><p>I honor him, this wicked guest, but I gladly let him sit alone.

They jingle with their tin, they jangle with their gold.\r\n\r\nThey are cold and they seek warmth in distilled liquors; they are over- heated and seek coolness in frozen spirits; they are all sick and addicted to public opinion.\r\n\r\nAll lusting and malignancy are at home here; but here there are also virtuous types, there is much effective and affected virtue: \u2013\r\n\r\nMuch effective virtue with scribble fingers and hard sit-and-wait flesh, blessed with little stars on their chests and padded fannyless daughters.\r\n\r\nThere is also much piety here and much devout spittle lick quaking and flatter cake baking before the God of Hosts.\r\n\r\n\u2018From on high\u2019 the star trickles down, and the merciful spittle; every starless chest meanwhile longs to get up high.\r\n\r\nThe moon has its farm, and the farm has its mooncalves; but the beggarly people and all effective beggarly virtue pray to everything that comes from the farm.\r\n\r\n\u2018I serve, you serve, we serve\u2019 \u2013 so begs all effective virtue to the prince, hoping that the deserved star will finally cling to the narrow chest!\r\n\r\nBut the moon still revolves around all that is earthly, and the prince too still revolves around what is most earthly \u2013 and that is the gold of the shopkeepers.\r\n\r\nThe God of Hosts is no God of gold bars; the prince proposes, but the shopkeeper \u2013 disposes!\r\n\r\nBy all that is bright and strong and good in you, oh Zarathustra, spit on this city of the shopkeepers and turn around!\r\n\r\nHere all blood flows tainted and tepid and frothy decrepit through all veins; spit on the big city which is the big scum trap where all spumy crap spumes together!\r\n\r\nSpit on this city of broken down souls and narrow chests, of prying eyes, of sticky fingers \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 on this city of the obtrusive, the insolent, the pencil- and roughnecks, the overheated and ambition eaten:\r\n\r\n\u2013 where everything that is crumbly, corrupted, lusty, dusky, overly mushy and pussy festers together confederately: \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 spit on the big city and turn around!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nAt this point, however, Zarathustra interrupted the foaming fool and clapped his hand over the fool\u2019s mouth.\r\n\r\n\u201cStop at last!\u201d cried Zarathustra. \u201cYour speech and your ways have nauseated me for a long time already!\r\n\r\nWhy have you lived so long near the swamp, that you yourself had to turn into a frog and a toad?\r\n\r\nDoesn\u2019t tainted and frothy, decrepit swamp blood flow in your own veins now, since you have learned to croak and lambast this way?\r\n\r\nWhy didn\u2019t you go into the woods? Or plow the earth? Isn\u2019t the sea full of green islands?\r\n\r\nI despise your despising; and if you warned me \u2013 why didn\u2019t you warn yourself?\r\n\r\nOut of love alone shall my despising and my warning bird fly up: but not out of the swamp! \u2013\r\n\r\nThey call you my ape, you foaming fool; but I call you my grunting swine \u2013 by grunting you will yet spoil my praise of folly.\r\n\r\nWhat was it after all that made you start grunting? That no one flattered you enough \u2013 so you sat down to this garbage in order to have reason to grunt a lot \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 in order to have reason for a lot of revenge! Indeed, all your foaming is revenge, you vain fool; I guessed you well!\r\n\r\nBut your fool\u2019s words injure me, even where you are right! And if Zarathustra\u2019s words were right even a hundred times: you would always do wrong with my words!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra, and he looked at the big city, sighed, and kept silent for a long time. Finally he spoke thus:\r\n\r\n\u201cI am nauseated too by this big city and not only by this fool. Here as there nothing can be bettered, nothing can be worsened.\r\n\r\nWoe to this big city! \u2013 And I wish I already saw the pillar of fire in which it will burn!\r\n\r\nFor such pillars of fire must precede the great noon. But this has its own time and its own destiny. \u2013\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, you fool, I give you this lesson in parting: where one can no longer love, there one should \u2013 pass by!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra and he passed by the fool and the big city."}, "id": 68}, {"data": {"uuid": "3a8425ff-8c91-4a8c-83a5-8ad185da65a9", "user": 1, "title": "On Apostates", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:51:56.489739+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:51:56.513414+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Apostates</h2><h3>1</h3><p>Alas, does everything lie wilted and grey that only recently stood green and colorful in this meadow?

For everywhere I smell little communities that have crept away; and where there are little rooms there are new Holy Joes in them and the reek of Holy Joes.\r\n\r\nThey sit long evenings together and say: \u201cLet us become as little children again and say \u2018dear God\u2019!\u201d \u2013 their mouths and stomachs ruined by pious confectioners.\r\n\r\nOr they watch long evenings the cunning lurking cross spider, which preaches cleverness to the spiders themselves and thus teaches: \u201cThere is good spinning among crosses!\u201d\r\n\r\nOr they sit the whole day with fishing rods at swamps and consider themselves deep for doing so; but whoever fishes where there are no fish \u2013 him I cannot even call superficial!\r\n\r\nOr they learn piously, joyously to stroke the harp, from a writer of songs who would gladly harp his way into the hearts of little young women \u2013 having grown weary of the little old women and their praise.\r\n\r\nOr they learn to shudder from a learned half-madman who waits in dark rooms for the spirits to come to him \u2013 and for the spirit to run away altogether!\r\n\r\nOr they listen to an old wandering harebrained whistler, who learned the triste of tones from tristful winds; now he whistles after the wind and preaches triste in tristful tones.\r\n\r\nAnd some of them have even become night watchmen; now they know how to blow into their horns and go around at night waking up old things that have long ago gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nI heard five expressions of old things yesterday night at the garden wall \u2013 they came from such old, saddened, dried up night watchmen.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor a father he doesn\u2019t care enough about his children: human fathers do this better!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cHe is too old! He does not even care about his children at all anymore\u201d \u2013 thus answered the other night watchman.\r\n\r\n\u201cDoes he even have children? No one can prove it, if he himself doesn\u2019t prove it! I wish he would just go ahead and prove it properly for once.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cProve it? As if he had ever proven anything! Proving is hard for him; he treasures instead that people have faith in him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed! Indeed! Faith makes him blessed, faith in him. That\u2019s just the way of old people! That\u2019s how it is with us too!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 Thus the two old night watchmen and light chasers spoke to one another, and they tooted their horns sadly; so it was yesterday at the garden wall.\r\n\r\nBut my heart convulsed with laughter and wanted to break and did not know what next, and it sank into my diaphragm.\r\n\r\nIndeed, this will be the death of me, that I choke from laughter when I see asses drunk and hear night watchmen doubting God\u2019s existence like this.\r\n\r\nHas the time not long since past even for all such doubting? Who is allowed anymore to wake up such old, sleeping, shade-loving things!\r\n\r\nIt has been over for the old gods for a long time now \u2013 and truly, they had a good cheerful gods\u2019 end!\r\n\r\nThey did not \u201ctwilight\u201d themselves to death \u2013 that is surely a lie! Instead, they just one day up and laughed themselves to death!\r\n\r\nThis happened when the most godless words were uttered by a god himself \u2013 the words: \u201cThere is one god. Thou shalt have no other god before me!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 an old grim-beard of a god, a jealous one forgot himself in this way: And all the gods laughed then and rocked in their chairs and cried: \u201cIs godliness not precisely that there are gods but no God?\u201d\r\n\r\nHe who has ears to hear, let him hear. \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra in the town that he loved and which is called The Motley Cow. From here he had only two more days to go to return to his cave and his animals, and his soul jubilated constantly at the nearness of his homecoming. \u2013"}, "id": 69}, {"data": {"uuid": "e6a6d3e1-1920-45f9-8617-073f0b2b48d0", "user": 1, "title": "The Homecoming", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:52:43.311405+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:52:43.331444+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Homecoming</h2><p>Oh solitude!

Such self-joy of body and soul calls itself: \u201cVirtue.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith its words of good and bad such self-joy shields itself as if with sacred groves; with the names of its happiness it banishes from itself everything contemptible.\r\n\r\nFrom itself it banishes all that is cowardly, saying: \u201cBad \u2013 that is cowardly!\u201d It considers contemptible those who always worry, sigh, complain, and whoever picks up even the smallest advantages.\r\n\r\nIt also despises all woe-wallowing wisdom, for indeed, there is also wisdom that blossoms in darkness, a night shadow wisdom that always sighs: \u201cAll is vain!\u201d\r\n\r\nIt holds shy mistrust in low esteem, and everyone who wants oaths instead of gazes and hands; and all wisdom that is all too mistrustful \u2013 because this is the way of cowardly souls.\r\n\r\nEven lower it esteems those quick to please, the dog-like who lie on their backs right away, the humble; and there is wisdom too that is humble and dog-like and pious and quick to please.\r\n\r\nUtterly disgusting and despicable to it are those who never defend themselves, who swallow poisonous spittle and evil stares; the all too patient, all-enduring, all-complacent: for they are the servile kind.\r\n\r\nWhether a person is servile before gods and gods\u2019 kicks, or before human beings and stupid human opinions: all servile kind it spits on, this blissful selfishness!\r\n\r\nBad: that is what it calls everything that is struck down, stingy and servile; fettered blinking eyes, oppressed hearts, and those false, yielding types who kiss with broad cowardly lips.\r\n\r\nAnd pseudo-wisdom: that is what it calls everything that servants and old men and weary people witticize; and especially the whole nasty nitwitted, twitwitted foolishness of priests!\r\n\r\nThe pseudo-wise, however, all the priests, the world weary and whoever\u2019s souls are of the woman\u2019s and servant\u2019s kind \u2013 oh how their game has always played tricks on selfishness!\r\n\r\nAnd precisely that was supposed to be virtue and be called virtue, that they played evil tricks on selfishness! And \u201cselfless\u201d \u2013 that is how they wished themselves, with good reason, all these world-weary cowards and cross spiders!\r\n\r\nBut for all of them now the day is coming, the transformation, the judgement sword, the great noon: then much shall be revealed!\r\n\r\nAnd whoever pronounces the ego hale and holy and selfishness blessed, indeed, he tells what he knows, this foreteller: \u201cLook, it is coming, it is near, the great noon!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 71}, {"data": {"uuid": "c88d65d8-03c5-42c7-a5cd-d9b12f322493", "user": 1, "title": "On the Spirit of Gravity", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:54:16.814659+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-11 17:14:27.799209+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On the Spirit of Gravity</h2><h3>1</h3><p>My mouth \u2013 is of the people: I speak too crudely and sincerely for Angora rabbits.

Much hidden goodness and strength is never guessed; the most exquisite delicacies find no tasters!\n\nWomen know this, the most exquisite ones: a bit fatter, a bit thinner \u2013 oh how much destiny lies in so little!\n\nThe human being is hard to discover and hardest still for himself; often the spirit lies about the soul. This is the spirit of gravity\u2019s doing.\n\nBut he will have discovered himself who speaks: \u201cThis is my good and evil.\u201d With this he has silenced the mole and dwarf who says: \u201cGood for all, evil for all.\u201d\n\nIndeed, nor do I like those for whom each thing is good and this world seems the very best. Such types I call the all-complacent.\n\nAll-complacency that knows how to taste everything \u2013 that is not the best taste! I honor the obstinate, choosy tongues and stomachs, which have learned to say \u201cI\u201d and \u201cYes\u201d and \u201cNo.\u201d\n\nBut chewing and digesting everything \u2013 that is truly the swine\u2019s style! To always say hee-yaw \u2013 only the ass learned that, and whoever is of its spirit! \u2013\n\nDeep yellow and hot red: this is what my taste wants \u2013 it mixes blood into all colors. But whoever whitewashes his house betrays to me a whitewashed soul.\n\nOne is in love with mummies, the other with ghosts; and both alike hostile to all flesh and blood \u2013 oh how they both offend my taste! For I love blood.\n\nAnd I do not want to dwell and dawdle where everyone spits and spews: that is just my taste \u2013 I would rather live among thieves and perjurers. No one carries gold in their mouth.\n\nBut even more repugnant to me are all lick spittles; and the most revolting animal of a human being that I found I christened \u201cparasite\u201d: it did not want to love and yet wanted to live off love.\n\nDamned I call all those who have only one choice: to become evil beasts or evil beast tamers: I would not build my hut among them.\n\nDamned I also call those who must always wait \u2013 they offend my taste: all the publicans and grocers and kings and other shop- and country-keepers.\n\nIndeed, I too learned to wait, and thoroughly \u2013 but only to wait for myself. And above all I learned to stand and walk and run and leap and climb and dance.\n\nBut this is my teaching; whoever wants to fly someday must first learn to stand and walk and run and climb and dance \u2013 one cannot fly one\u2019s way to flight!\n\nOn rope ladders I learned to climb to many a window, with agile legs I climbed up high masts: to sit atop tall masts of knowledge struck me as no small bliss \u2013\n\n\u2013 to flicker like small flames atop tall masts; a small light, to be sure, and yet a great comfort for stranded sailors and shipwreck survivors!\n\nBy many a trail and manner I came to my truth; not on one ladder did I climb to my height, where my eye roams out into my distance.\n\nAnd I never liked asking the way \u2013 that always offended my taste! I preferred to question and try the ways myself.\n\nAll my coming and going was a trying and questioning \u2013 and truly, one must also learn to answer such questioning! That, however \u2013 is my taste:\n\n\u2013 not good, not bad, but my taste, of which I am no longer shameful nor secretive.\n\n\u201cThis \u2013 it turns out \u2013 is my way \u2013 where is yours?\u201d \u2013 That is how I answered those who asked me \u201cthe way.\u201d The way after all \u2013 it does not exist!\n\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 72}, {"data": {"uuid": "8fef4482-0c22-468b-9a2a-b76a8d32d3ee", "user": 1, "title": "On Old and New Tablets", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:55:49.153202+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:55:49.191212+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Old and New Tablets</h2><h3>1</h3><p>Here I sit and wait, old broken tablets around me and also new tablets only partially written upon. When will my hour come?</p><p>\u2013 the hour of my going down, going under: for I want to return to mankind once more.</p><p>This is what I wait for now; signs must come to me first that it is my hour \u2013 namely the laughing lion with a swarm of doves.</p><p>Meanwhile I talk to myself as one who has time. No one tells me anything new, and so I tell myself to myself.</p><h3>2</h3><p>When I came to mankind, I found them sitting on an old conceit: they all conceited to have known for a long time what is good and evil for humanity.</p><p>To them all talk of virtue seemed an old worn out thing; and whoever wanted to sleep well even spoke about \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d before going to bed.</p><p>I disturbed this sleepiness when I taught: what is good and evil no one knows yet \u2013 except for the creator!</p><p>He, however, is the one who creates a goal for mankind and gives the earth its meaning and its future: This one first creates the possibility that something can be good and evil.</p><p>I told them to overthrow their old professorial chairs wherever that old conceit had sat; I told them to laugh at their great masters of virtue and their saints and poets and world redeemers.</p><p>I told them to laugh at their gloomy wise men and at any who ever perched in warning, like black scarecrows, in the tree of life.</p><p>I sat down alongside their great road of graves and even among carrion and vultures \u2013 and I laughed at all their yesteryear and its rotting, decaying glory.</p><p>Indeed, like preachers of repentance and fools I screamed bloody murder about all their great and small \u2013 that their best is so very small! that their most evil is so very small! \u2013 I had to laugh.</p><p>Thus my wild longing cried and laughed out of me, born in the mountains, a wild wisdom surely! \u2013 my great, winging, roaring longing.</p><p>And often it swept me off my feet and up and away, in the midst of my laughter, where I flew quivering, an arrow, through sun-drunken delight:</p><p>\u2013 off into distant futures not yet glimpsed in dreams, into hotter souths than any artist ever dreamed of; there, where dancing gods are ashamed of all clothing:</p><p>\u2013 so that I must speak in parables and limp and stutter like the poets; and truly, I am ashamed that I must still be a poet! \u2013</p><p>Where all becoming seemed to me the dance of gods and the mischief of gods, and the world seemed unloosed and frolicsome and as though it were fleeing back to itself:</p><p>\u2013 as an eternal fleeing from and seeking each other again of many gods, as the blissful contradicting, again-hearing, again-nearing each other of many gods:</p><p>Where all time seemed to me a blissful mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which played blissfully with the sting of freedom:</p><p>Where I once again found my old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit of gravity, and everything he created: compulsion, statute, necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:</p><p>For must there not exist something over which one dances, dances away? Must not, for the sake of the light and the lightest \u2013 moles and heavy dwarves exist? \u2013</p><h3>3</h3><p>It was there too that I picked up the word \u201coverman\u201d along the way, and that the human is something that must be overcome,</p><p>\u2013 that human being is a bridge and not an end; counting itself blessed for its noon and evening as the way to new dawns:</p><p>\u2013 the Zarathustra-words about the great noon, and whatever else I suspended above mankind like purple second sunsets.</p><p>Truly, I allowed them to see new stars together with new nights; and over clouds and day and night I even spread laughter like a colorful tent.</p><p>I taught them all my creating and striving: to carry together into one what is fragment in mankind and riddle and horrid accident \u2013</p><p>\u2013 as poet, riddle guesser and redeemer of chance I taught them to work on the future, and to creatively redeem everything that was.</p><p>To redeem what is past in mankind and to recreate all \u201cIt was\u201d until the will speaks: \u201cBut I wanted it so! I shall want it so \u2013\u201d</p><p>This I told them was redemption, this alone I taught them to call redemption. \u2013</p><p>Now I wait for my redemption \u2013 so that I can go to them for the last time.</p><p>And I want to go to mankind one more time: among them I want to go under, dying I want to give them my richest gift!</p><p>I learned this from the sun when it goes down, the super-rich one: it pours gold into the sea from its inexhaustible wealth \u2013</p><p>\u2013 such that even the poorest fisherman rows with golden oars! Because I saw this once and did not tire of my tears as I gazed on. \u2013</p><p>Zarathustra too wants to go under like the sun; now he sits and waits, old broken tablets around him and also new tablets \u2013 partially written upon.</p><h3>4</h3><p>Look here, here is a new tablet, but where are my brothers to help me carry it to the valley and into hearts of flesh?</p><p>This is what my great love of the farthest demands: do not spare your neighbor! Human being is something that must be overcome.</p><p>There are manifold ways and means of overcoming: you see to it! But only a jester thinks: \u201chuman being can also be leaped over.\u201d</p><p>Overcome yourself even in your neighbor; and you should not let anyone give you a right that you can rob for yourself !</p><p>What you do no one can do to you in turn. Observe, there is no retribution.</p><p>Whoever cannot command himself should obey. And though many a person can command himself, much is still missing before he also obeys himself !</p><h3>5</h3><p>This is how souls of the noble kind would have it: they want nothing for free, and life least of all.</p><p>Whoever is of the rabble wants to live for free; we others, however, to whom life gave itself \u2013 we always reflect on what we can best give in exchange!</p><p>And truly, it is a noble phrase that says: \u201cwhat life promises us, we want to keep \u2013 for life!\u201d</p><p>One should not want to enjoy where one gives nothing to enjoy. And, one should not want to enjoy!</p><p>Enjoyment and innocence, you see, are the most bashful things: both do not want to be sought. One should have them \u2013 but one should sooner seek guilt and suffering! \u2013</p><h3>6</h3><p>Oh my brothers, whoever is a firstborn is always sacrificed. But now we are the firstborns.</p><p>We all bleed on secret sacrificial altars; we all burn and broil in honor of old idols.</p><p>Our best is still young; that tempts old gums. Our flesh is tender, our hide is mere lambskin \u2013 how could we not tempt old idol priests!</p><p>Even in ourselves he still lives, the old idol priest, who roasts up our best for his banquet. Oh my brothers, how could firstborn not be sacrifices!</p><p>But our kind wants it so; and I love those who do not want to preserve themselves. Those who are going under I love with my whole love: because they are going over. \u2013</p><h3>7</h3><p>To be true \u2013 this few can do! And whoever can, does not yet want to! But least of all the good can do it.</p><p>Oh these good! \u2013 Good people never speak the truth; for the spirit, being good in this manner is a disease.</p><p>They give way, these good, they give themselves up, their heart repeats words, their ground obeys; but whoever obeys, he does not hear himself !</p><p>Everything that the good call evil must come together, in order to give birth to one truth; oh my brothers, are you also evil enough for this truth?</p><p>Audacious daring, long mistrust, the cruel no, surfeit, the cutting into what is alive \u2013 how rarely this comes together! But from such semen \u2013 truth is begotten!</p><p>Side by side with bad conscience all science has grown so far. Break, break me these old tablets, you seekers of knowledge!</p><h3>8</h3><p>If timbers span the water, if footbridges and railings leap over the river, then surely the one who says \u201cEverything is in flux\u201d has no credibility.</p><p>Instead, even the dummies contradict him. \u201cWhat?\u201d say the dummies, \u201ceverything is supposed to be in flux? But the timbers and the railings are over the river!</p><p>Over the river everything is firm, all the values of things, the bridges, concepts, all \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 \u2013 all of this is firm!\u201d \u2013</p><p>But when the hard winter comes, the beast tamer of rivers, then even the wittiest learn to mistrust, and, sure enough, then not only the dummies say: \u201cShould everything not \u2013 stand still?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBasically everything stands still\u201d \u2013 that is a real winter doctrine, a good thing for sterile times, a good comfort for hibernators and stove huggers.</p><p>\u201cBasically everything stands still\u201d \u2013 but against this preaches the thaw wind!</p><p>The thaw wind, a bull that is no plowing bull \u2013 a raging bull, a destroyer that breaks ice with its wrathful horns! But ice \u2013 breaks footbridges!</p><p>Yes my brothers, is everything not now in flux? Have all railings and footbridges not fallen into the water? Who could still hang on to \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d?</p><p>\u201cWoe to us! Hail to us! The thaw wind is blowing!\u201d \u2013 Preach me this, oh my brothers, in all the streets!</p><h3>9</h3><p>There is an old delusion called good and evil. So far the wheel of this delusion has revolved around soothsayers and astrologers.</p><p>Once people believed in soothsayers and astrologers, and therefore they believed \u201cEverything is fate: you should, because you must!\u201d</p><p>Then later people mistrusted all soothsayers and astrologers, and there- fore they believed \u201cEverything is freedom: you can, because you want to!\u201d</p><p>Yes, my brothers, so far we have merely deluded ourselves, but not known about the stars and the future, and therefore we have merely deluded ourselves, but not known about good and evil!</p><h3>10</h3><p>\u201cThou shalt not rob! Thou shalt not kill!\u201d \u2013 such words were once held holy; before them one bent the knee, bowed the head and removed one\u2019s shoes.</p><p>But I ask you: where in the world have there ever been better robbers and killers than such holy words?</p><p>Is there not in all life itself \u2013 robbing and killing? And for such words to have been called holy, was truth itself not \u2013 killed?</p><p>Or was it a sermon of death that pronounced holy what contradicted and contravened all life? \u2013 Yes my brothers, break, break me the old tablets!</p><h3>11</h3><p>This is my pity for everything past, that I see it is abandoned \u2013</p><p>\u2013 abandoned to the favor, the spirit, the madness of each generation that comes along, and interprets everything that was as the bridge to itself!</p><p>A great despot could come along, a shrewd monster, who with his favor and disfavor could force and forge the whole past, until it became a bridge to him, and omen and herald and harbinger.</p><p>But this is the other danger and my other pity: whoever is of the rabble, their remembrance goes no further back than their grandfather \u2013 and with their grandfather time ends.</p><p>Thus all the past is abandoned; because it could happen one day that the rabble would become ruler and in its shallow water all time would drown.</p><p>Therefore, my brothers, we need a new nobility, which is the adversary of all rabble and all despotic rule and which writes anew the word \u201cnoble\u201d on new tablets.</p><p>Many noble ones are needed, to be sure, and many kinds of noble ones for nobility to exist! Or, as I once spoke in parables: \u201cPrecisely that is godliness, that there are gods but no God!\u201d</p><h3>12</h3><p>Oh my brothers, I consecrate and conduct you to a new nobility: you shall be my begetters and growers and sowers of the future \u2013</p><p>\u2013 to be sure, not to a nobility that you could buy like the shopkeepers and with shopkeepers\u2019 gold, for everything that has a price has little value.</p><p>Not where you come from shall constitute your honor from now on, but instead where you are going! Your will and your foot, which wants to go over and beyond yourself \u2013 let that constitute your new honor!</p><p>Certainly not that you served a prince \u2013 what do princes matter anymore! Or that you became a bulwark for what stands, to make it to stand more firmly!</p><p>Not that your kinfolk became courtiers at court, and learned to stand long hours like a colorful flamingo in shallow ponds.</p><p>\u2013 For being able to stand is a merit among courtiers; and all courtiers believe that part of blessedness after death is \u2013 being allowed to sit!</p><p>Nor that a spirit they called holy led your forefathers to promised lands, which I do not praise; because where the worst of all trees grew, the cross \u2013 there is nothing to praise about that land!</p><p>And truly, wherever this \u201choly ghost\u201d led its knights, in such cru- sades goats and geese and pious crisscrossing contradictors ran in front !</p><p>Oh my brothers, your nobility should not look back, but out there! You should be exiles from all father- and forefatherlands!</p><p>You should love your children\u2019s land; let this love be your new nobility \u2013 the undiscovered land in the furthest sea! For that land I command your sails to seek and seek!</p><p>You should make it up in your children that you are the children of your fathers; thus you should redeem all that is past! This new tablet I place above you!</p><h3>13</h3><p>\u201cWhy live? All is vain! Life \u2013 that is threshing straw; life \u2013 that is burning oneself and yet not getting warm.\u201d</p><p>Such archaic babble still passes for \u201cwisdom\u201d; but it is honored more highly because it smells old and musty. Even mustiness ennobles.</p><p>Children might speak like this: they fear fire because it burned them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.</p><p>And whoever is always \u201cthreshing straw,\u201d why should he be allowed to revile threshing? One really should muzzle such oxen!</p><p>Such people sit down at the table and bring nothing along, not even a good appetite \u2013 and now they revile saying \u201cAll is vain!\u201d</p><p>But eating and drinking well, my brothers, is really no vain art! Break, break me the tablets of the never-glad!</p><h3>14</h3><p>\u201cTo the clean all is clean\u201d \u2013 that is what folks say. But I say to you: \u201cto swine all becomes swine!\u201d</p><p>This is why the rapturous and the head-hangers, whose hearts also hang down, preach: \u201cThe world itself is a filthy monster.\u201d</p><p>Because they are all unclean in spirit, especially those who have neither rest nor respite, unless they see the world from the hinter side \u2013 these hinterworldlings!</p><p>To their faces I say, even if it does not sound kind: the world resembles a human being in that it has a behind \u2013 that much is true!</p><p>There is much filth in the world: that much is true! But the world itself is not therefore a filthy monster!</p><p>There is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smells foul: nausea itself creates wings and water-divining powers!</p><p>Even in the best there is something that nauseates; and the best is still something that must be overcome!</p><p>Yes my brothers, there is much wisdom in the fact that there is much filth in the world! \u2013</p><h3>15</h3><p>Such sayings I heard the pious hinterworldlings speak to their conscience, and truly, without malice and falseness \u2013 even though there is nothing more false in the world, nor more malicious.</p><p>\u201cJust let the world be the world! Do not lift so much as a finger against it!\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf someone wants to strangle and stab and slice and dice the people, let him; do not lift so much as a finger against it! That way they will yet learn to renounce the world.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd your own reason \u2013 this you yourself should smother and strangle, because it is a reason of this world \u2013 that way you yourself will learn to renounce the world.\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u2013 Break, break me these old tablets of the pious, my brothers! Gainsay me the sayings of the world slanderers!</p><h3>16</h3><p>\u201cWhoever learns much, he forgets all vehement desire\u201d \u2013 today this is whispered throughout all dark lanes.</p><p>\u201cWisdom makes weary, nothing is worth it; thou shalt not desire!\u201d \u2013 this new tablet I found hanging even in the open markets.</p><p>Break, my brothers, break me this new tablet too! The world-weary hung it there and the preachers of death, and the jailers as well; just look, it too is a sermon for slavery!</p><p>The reason they have such ruined stomachs is because they learned badly and not what was best, and everything too early and everything too fast; and they ate badly \u2013</p><p>\u2013 you see, their spirit is a ruined stomach: it recommends death! Because truly, my brothers, the spirit is a stomach!</p><p>Life is a well of joy; but for those out of whom the ruined stomach speaks, the father of gloom, all wells are poisoned.</p><p>Knowing: that is joy to the lion-willed! But whoever has grown weary is himself merely being \u201cwilled,\u201d and all waves toss him around.</p><p>And so it always is with weak willed persons; they lose themselves along the way. And finally their own weariness asks: \u201cWhy did we ever embark on ways! It\u2019s all the same!\u201d</p><p>To their ears it is music when they hear preached: \u201cNothing is worth it! You shall not will!\u201d But this is a sermon for slavery.</p><p>Yes my brothers, as a fresh roaring wind Zarathustra comes to all who are weary of their way; many noses he will yet make sneeze!</p><p>My free breath also blows through walls, and down into prisons and imprisoned spirits!</p><p>Willing liberates because willing is creating: thus I teach. And you should learn only for creating!</p><p>And even this learning you shall first learn from me, namely learning-well! \u2013 He who has ears to hear, let him hear!</p><h3>17</h3><p>There sits the skiff \u2013 over there perhaps is the entryway to the great nothing. But who wants to board this \u201cperhaps\u201d?</p><p>None of you wants to board the death skiff! Then why do you want to be world-weary!</p><p>World-weary! And you have not even become earth-alienated yet! I found you still lusting for the earth, still in love with your own earthly weariness!</p><p>Not for nothing does your lip hang \u2013 a little earthly wish still sits on it! And in your eye \u2013 doesn\u2019t a little cloud of unforgotten earthly joy float there?</p><p>There are many good inventions on earth, some useful, others pleasant, for whose sake the earth is lovable.</p><p>And some of what is there has been invented so well that it is like a woman\u2019s breasts: useful and pleasant at the same time.</p><p>But you world-weary! You earth-lazy! You should be flogged with switches! With floggings you should be made to step lively again.</p><p>After all, if you are not misfits and moribund wretches of whom the earth is weary, then you are sly sloths or nibbling, creeping pleasure cats. And if you do not want to run again with gusto, then you should \u2013 pass away!</p><p>One should not try to be a physician for the incurable: thus Zarathustra teaches \u2013 and so you should pass away!</p><p>But it takes more courage to make an end than to make a new verse: that all physicians and poets know.</p><h3>18</h3><p>Oh my brothers, there are tablets created by weariness, and tablets created by rotten laziness; even though they talk the same, still they want to be heard differently.</p><p>See this languishing specimen here! He is merely one span away from his goal, but out of weariness he has laid himself defiantly here in the dust \u2013 this valiant man!</p><p>Out of weariness he yawns at the road and the earth and the goal and himself; not one more step will he take \u2013 this valiant one!</p><p>Now the sun burns on him and the dogs lick at his sweat; but he lies there in his defiance and would rather die of thirst \u2013</p><p>\u2013 die of thirst one span away from his goal! Truly, you will yet have to drag him to his heaven by the hair \u2013 this hero!</p><p>Better still, just let him lie where he has laid himself so that sleep can come to him, the comforter, with its cooling rushing rain:</p><p>Let him lie until he awakens on his own \u2013 until he renounces all weariness on his own and whatever weariness taught through him!</p><p>Only, my brothers, chase the dogs away from him, the lazy creepers and the whole raving rout \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the whole raving rout of \u201cthe educated\u201d that feasts on the sweat of every hero!</p><h3>19</h3><p>I draw circles around me and sacred borders; ever fewer climb with me on ever higher mountains \u2013 I build a range of mountains out of ever more sacred mountains.</p><p>But wherever you may climb with me, my brothers, see to it that a parasite does not climb with you!</p><p>Parasite: that is a worm, a crawling writhing worm that wants to glut itself on your infected nicks and niches.</p><p>And its art consists in guessing where climbing souls are weary; in your grief and dismay, in your tender modesty it builds its disgusting nest.</p><p>Where the strong is weak, the noble one all too mild \u2013 in that place it builds its disgusting nest; the parasite lives where the great person has little nicks and niches.</p><p>What is the highest species of all being and what is the least? The parasite is the least of species, but whoever is of the highest species nourishes the most parasites.</p><p>After all, the soul that has the longest ladder and reaches down farthest \u2013 how could it not have the most parasites clinging to it?</p><p>The most encompassing soul, which can run and stray and roam farthest within itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy plunges itself into chance \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the soul that loves being, but submerges into becoming; the having soul that wants to rise to willing and desiring \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the soul that flees itself and catches up to itself in the widest circle; the wisest soul which folly persuades most sweetly \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the one that loves itself most, in which all things have their current and recurrent and ebb and flow \u2013 indeed, how could the highest soul not have the worst parasites?</p><h3>20</h3><p>Oh my brothers, am I perhaps cruel? But I say: if something is falling, one should also give it a push!</p><p>Everything of today \u2013 it is falling, it is failing: who would want to stop it! But I \u2013 I want to push it too!</p><p>Do you know the kind of lust that rolls stones down into steep depths? \u2013 These people of today; just look at how they roll into my depths!</p><p>I am a prelude of better players, my brothers! An exemplary play! Act according to my example!</p><p>And whomever you cannot teach to fly, him you should teach \u2013 to fall faster!</p><h3>21</h3><p>I love the valiant, but it is not enough to be a fierce combatant \u2013 one must also know whom to combat!</p><p>And often there is more valiance in someone controlling himself and passing by, so that he saves himself for the worthier enemy!</p><p>You should have only those enemies whom you hate, but not enemies to despise; you must be proud of your enemy: this I taught you already once before.</p><p>For the worthier enemy, my friends, you should save yourselves, and therefore you must pass by much \u2013</p><p>\u2013 especially pass by much rabble that thunders in your ears about folk and peoples.</p><p>Keep your eye clear of their pros and cons! There is much justice, much injustice here; whoever watches becomes angry.</p><p>Look around, beat them down \u2013 it\u2019s all the same here; therefore go away into the woods and lay your swords to sleep!</p><p>Go your ways! And let folk and peoples go theirs! \u2013 dark ways, to be sure, on which not a single hope flashes anymore!</p><p>Let the shopkeeper rule where all that is left to glitter \u2013 is shopkeepers\u2019 gold! The time of kings is no more; what calls itself a people today deserves no kings.</p><p>Just look at how these peoples themselves do the same as the shopkeepers; they pluck themselves the tiniest advantage from any dustpan!</p><p>They lie in wait for one another, they look in hate at one another \u2013 this they call \u201cgood neighbors.\u201d Oh happy distant time when a people said to themselves: \u201cI want to be ruler over peoples!\u201d</p><p>For the best should rule, my brothers, and the best also want to rule! And wherever the teaching says differently, there \u2013 the best are missing.</p><h3>22</h3><p>If they had bread for free, oh no! What would they clamor for! Their sustainment \u2013 that is their real entertainment, and they should have it hard!</p><p>They are beasts of prey: in their \u201cworking\u201d \u2013 preying is there too; in their \u201cearning\u201d \u2013 outwitting is there too! Therefore they should have it hard!</p><p>They should become better beasts of prey, more subtle, more clever, more human-like: the human being, after all, is the best beast of prey.</p><p>Human beings have already successfully preyed upon the virtues of all animals; this is because human beings have had the hardest time of all animals.</p><p>Only the birds are above him. And if human beings were to learn even to fly, watch out! How high \u2013 would his lust to prey fly!</p><h3>23</h3><p>This is how I want man and woman: fit for war the one, fit for bearing children the other, but both fit to dance in head and limb.</p><p>And let each day be a loss to us on which we did not dance once! And let each truth be false to us which was not greeted by one laugh!</p><h3>24</h3><p>In taking your wedding vows \u2013 see to it that you are not making your bedding vows. Vowing too quickly results in \u2013 breaking vows! And better vow breaking than vow bending and vow pretending! A woman once said to me: \u201cSure, I broke my wedding vows, but first my wedding vows broke \u2013 me!\u201d</p><p>The worst of the vengeful I always found to be the mismatched couples: they take it out on the whole world that they are no longer singles.</p><p>This is why I want honest people to speak honestly to one another: \u201cWe love each other; let us see to it that we keep loving each other! Or did we promise by mistake?\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cGive us a trial period and a small marriage, so that we can see whether we are fit for a big marriage! It is a big thing to always be in twos!\u201d</p><p>Thus I counsel all honest people; and what then would my love for the overman be, and for everything else that is to come, if I counseled and conveyed otherwise!</p><p>Not merely to reproduce, but instead to surproduce \u2013 to that goal, my brothers, may the garden of marriage help you!</p><h3>25</h3><p>Whoever has become wise about ancient origins will surely, in the end, seek new wells of the future and new origins.</p><p>Yes my brothers, it will not be overly long and new peoples will originate and new wells will roar down into new depths.</p><p>An earthquake, after all \u2013 it buries many wells, it causes much dying of thirst: it also brings to light inner powers and secrets.</p><p>An earthquake reveals new wells. In an earthquake of ancient peoples new wells break out.</p><p>And whoever cries out there: \u201cLook, here is a fountain for many who thirst, a heart for many who long, a will for many tools\u201d \u2013 around him gathers a people, that is: many who try.</p><p>Who can command, who must obey \u2013 here it is tried! Indeed, with what long searching and guessing and lack of success and learning and trying again!</p><p>Human society: it is an experiment, this I teach \u2013 a long search: but it searches for the commander! \u2013</p><p>\u2013 an experiment, oh my brothers! And not a \u201ccontract!\u201d Break, break me such words of the soft hearted and half-and-halfs!</p><h3>26</h3><p>My brothers! In whom does the greatest danger lie for all of future humanity? Is it not in the good and the just?</p><p>\u2013 is it not in those who speak and feel in their hearts: \u201cWe already know what is good and just, and we have it too; woe to any who still search here!\u201d</p><p>And whatever harm the evil may do, the harm of the good is the most harmful harm!</p><p>And whatever harm the world slanderers may do, the harm of the good is the most harmful harm!</p><p>My brothers, there was a man who once looked into the hearts of the good and the just, and he spoke: \u201cThey are pharisees.\u201d But he was not understood.</p><p>The good and the just themselves were not permitted to understand him: their spirit is imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the good is unfathomably clever.</p><p>But this is the truth: the good must be pharisees \u2013 they have no choice!</p><p>The good must crucify the one who invents his own virtue! This is the truth!</p><p>The second one, however, who discovered their land, the land, hearts and soil of the good and just: he was the one who asked: \u201cWhom do they hate the most?\u201d</p><p>The creator they hate the most; he who breaks tablets and old values, the breaker \u2013 him they call the lawbreaker.</p><p>Because the good, you see \u2013 they can not create: they are always the beginning of the end \u2013</p><p>\u2013 they crucify the one who writes new values on new tablets, they sacrifice the future to themselves \u2013 they crucify all future huma- nity!</p><p>The good \u2013 they were always the beginning of the end. \u2013</p><h3>27</h3><p>Oh my brothers, have you even understood these words? And what I once said about the \u201clast human being?\u201d \u2013</p><p>In whom does the greatest danger lie for all of future humanity? Is it not in the good and the just?</p><p>Break, break me the good and the just! \u2013 Oh my brothers, have you even understood these words?</p><h3>28</h3><p>You flee from me? You are frightened? You tremble before these words?</p><p>My brothers, when I told you to break the good and the tablets of the good, then for the first time I launched mankind onto their high seas.</p><p>And only now the great fright comes to them, the great looking-around oneself, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great seasickness.</p><p>False coasts and false securities were taught you by the good; in the lies of the good you were born and bielded. Everything has been duplicitous and twisted from the ground up by the good.</p><p>But whoever discovered the land \u201chuman being\u201d also discovered the land \u201chuman future.\u201d Now you will be seafarers, brave and patient!</p><p>Walk upright for once, my brothers, learn to walk upright! The sea is stormy: Many want to right themselves again on you.</p><p>The sea is stormy: Everything is in the sea. Well then! Well now! You old salts!</p><p>What fatherland! There our helm wants to steer, where our children\u2019s land is! Out there, stormier than the sea, storms our great longing! \u2013</p><h3>29</h3><p>\u201cWhy so hard!\u201d \u2013 the kitchen coal once said to the diamond. \u201cAre we not close relatives?\u201d</p><p>Why so soft? Oh my brothers, this I ask you: for are you not \u2013 my brothers?</p><p>Why so soft, so retiring and yielding? Why is there so much denying and denial in your hearts? And so little destiny in your gazes?</p><p>And if you do not want to be destinies and inexorable, how could you triumph with me?</p><p>And if your hardness does not want to flash and undo and cut through, how could you one day create with me?</p><p>The creators are hard after all. And it must seem like bliss to you to press your hand upon millennia as if upon wax \u2013</p><p>\u2013 bliss to write upon the will of millennia as if upon bronze \u2013 harder than bronze, more noble than bronze. Only the most noble is perfectly hard.</p><p>This new tablet, my brothers, I place above you: become hard! \u2013</p><h3>30</h3><p>Oh you my will! You turning point of all need, you point of my necessity! Preserve me from all small victories!</p><p>You ordaining of my soul, that I call destiny! You in-me, over-me! Preserve and save me for a great destiny!</p><p>And your ultimate greatness, my will, save that for your ultimate \u2013 that you be inexorable in your victory! Indeed, who was not defeated in his victory!</p><p>Indeed, whose eye did not darken in this drunken twilight! Indeed, whose foot did not stagger and forget how to stand in victory!</p><p>\u2013 That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noon; ready and ripe like glowing bronze, clouds pregnant with lightning and swelling udders of milk \u2013</p><p>\u2013 ready for myself and for my most hidden will; a bow burning for its arrow, an arrow burning for its star \u2013</p><p>\u2013 a star ready and ripe in its noon, glowing, skewered, blissful with annihilating arrows of the sun \u2013</p><p>\u2013 a sun itself and an inexorable will of the sun, ready for annihilating in victory!</p><p>Oh will, turning point of all need, you my point of necessity!

When will my hour come?\r\n\r\n\u2013 the hour of my going down, going under: for I want to return to mankind once more.\r\n\r\nThis is what I wait for now; signs must come to me first that it is my hour \u2013 namely the laughing lion with a swarm of doves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I talk to myself as one who has time. No one tells me anything new, and so I tell myself to myself.\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nWhen I came to mankind, I found them sitting on an old conceit: they all conceited to have known for a long time what is good and evil for humanity.\r\n\r\nTo them all talk of virtue seemed an old worn out thing; and whoever wanted to sleep well even spoke about \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d before going to bed.\r\n\r\nI disturbed this sleepiness when I taught: what is good and evil no one knows yet \u2013 except for the creator!\r\n\r\nHe, however, is the one who creates a goal for mankind and gives the earth its meaning and its future: This one first creates the possibility that something can be good and evil.\r\n\r\nI told them to overthrow their old professorial chairs wherever that old conceit had sat; I told them to laugh at their great masters of virtue and their saints and poets and world redeemers.\r\n\r\nI told them to laugh at their gloomy wise men and at any who ever perched in warning, like black scarecrows, in the tree of life.\r\n\r\nI sat down alongside their great road of graves and even among carrion and vultures \u2013 and I laughed at all their yesteryear and its rotting, decaying glory.\r\n\r\nIndeed, like preachers of repentance and fools I screamed bloody murder about all their great and small \u2013 that their best is so very small! that their most evil is so very small! \u2013 I had to laugh.\r\n\r\nThus my wild longing cried and laughed out of me, born in the mountains, a wild wisdom surely! \u2013 my great, winging, roaring longing.\r\n\r\nAnd often it swept me off my feet and up and away, in the midst of my laughter, where I flew quivering, an arrow, through sun-drunken delight:\r\n\r\n\u2013 off into distant futures not yet glimpsed in dreams, into hotter souths than any artist ever dreamed of; there, where dancing gods are ashamed of all clothing:\r\n\r\n\u2013 so that I must speak in parables and limp and stutter like the poets; and truly, I am ashamed that I must still be a poet! \u2013\r\n\r\nWhere all becoming seemed to me the dance of gods and the mischief of gods, and the world seemed unloosed and frolicsome and as though it were fleeing back to itself:\r\n\r\n\u2013 as an eternal fleeing from and seeking each other again of many gods, as the blissful contradicting, again-hearing, again-nearing each other of many gods:\r\n\r\nWhere all time seemed to me a blissful mockery of moments, where necessity was freedom itself, which played blissfully with the sting of freedom:\r\n\r\nWhere I once again found my old devil and arch-enemy, the spirit of gravity, and everything he created: compulsion, statute, necessity and consequence and purpose and will and good and evil:\r\n\r\nFor must there not exist something over which one dances, dances away? Must not, for the sake of the light and the lightest \u2013 moles and heavy dwarves exist? \u2013\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nIt was there too that I picked up the word \u201coverman\u201d along the way, and that the human is something that must be overcome,\r\n\r\n\u2013 that human being is a bridge and not an end; counting itself blessed for its noon and evening as the way to new dawns:\r\n\r\n\u2013 the Zarathustra-words about the great noon, and whatever else I suspended above mankind like purple second sunsets.\r\n\r\nTruly, I allowed them to see new stars together with new nights; and over clouds and day and night I even spread laughter like a colorful tent.\r\n\r\nI taught them all my creating and striving: to carry together into one what is fragment in mankind and riddle and horrid accident \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 as poet, riddle guesser and redeemer of chance I taught them to work on the future, and to creatively redeem everything that was.\r\n\r\nTo redeem what is past in mankind and to recreate all \u201cIt was\u201d until the will speaks: \u201cBut I wanted it so! I shall want it so \u2013\u201d\r\n\r\nThis I told them was redemption, this alone I taught them to call redemption. \u2013\r\n\r\nNow I wait for my redemption \u2013 so that I can go to them for the last time.\r\n\r\nAnd I want to go to mankind one more time: among them I want to go under, dying I want to give them my richest gift!\r\n\r\nI learned this from the sun when it goes down, the super-rich one: it pours gold into the sea from its inexhaustible wealth \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 such that even the poorest fisherman rows with golden oars! Because I saw this once and did not tire of my tears as I gazed on. \u2013\r\n\r\nZarathustra too wants to go under like the sun; now he sits and waits, old broken tablets around him and also new tablets \u2013 partially written upon.\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nLook here, here is a new tablet, but where are my brothers to help me carry it to the valley and into hearts of flesh?\r\n\r\nThis is what my great love of the farthest demands: do not spare your neighbor! Human being is something that must be overcome.\r\n\r\nThere are manifold ways and means of overcoming: you see to it! But only a jester thinks: \u201chuman being can also be leaped over.\u201d\r\n\r\nOvercome yourself even in your neighbor; and you should not let anyone give you a right that you can rob for yourself !\r\n\r\nWhat you do no one can do to you in turn. Observe, there is no retribution.\r\n\r\nWhoever cannot command himself should obey. And though many a person can command himself, much is still missing before he also obeys himself !\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThis is how souls of the noble kind would have it: they want nothing for free, and life least of all.\r\n\r\nWhoever is of the rabble wants to live for free; we others, however, to whom life gave itself \u2013 we always reflect on what we can best give in exchange!\r\n\r\nAnd truly, it is a noble phrase that says: \u201cwhat life promises us, we want to keep \u2013 for life!\u201d\r\n\r\nOne should not want to enjoy where one gives nothing to enjoy. And, one should not want to enjoy!\r\n\r\nEnjoyment and innocence, you see, are the most bashful things: both do not want to be sought. One should have them \u2013 but one should sooner seek guilt and suffering! \u2013\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, whoever is a firstborn is always sacrificed. But now we are the firstborns.\r\n\r\nWe all bleed on secret sacrificial altars; we all burn and broil in honor of old idols.\r\n\r\nOur best is still young; that tempts old gums. Our flesh is tender, our hide is mere lambskin \u2013 how could we not tempt old idol priests!\r\n\r\nEven in ourselves he still lives, the old idol priest, who roasts up our best for his banquet. Oh my brothers, how could firstborn not be sacrifices!\r\n\r\nBut our kind wants it so; and I love those who do not want to preserve themselves. Those who are going under I love with my whole love: because they are going over. \u2013\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nTo be true \u2013 this few can do! And whoever can, does not yet want to! But least of all the good can do it.\r\n\r\nOh these good! \u2013 Good people never speak the truth; for the spirit, being good in this manner is a disease.\r\n\r\nThey give way, these good, they give themselves up, their heart repeats words, their ground obeys; but whoever obeys, he does not hear himself !\r\n\r\nEverything that the good call evil must come together, in order to give birth to one truth; oh my brothers, are you also evil enough for this truth?\r\n\r\nAudacious daring, long mistrust, the cruel no, surfeit, the cutting into what is alive \u2013 how rarely this comes together! But from such semen \u2013 truth is begotten!\r\n\r\nSide by side with bad conscience all science has grown so far. Break, break me these old tablets, you seekers of knowledge!\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nIf timbers span the water, if footbridges and railings leap over the river, then surely the one who says \u201cEverything is in flux\u201d has no credibility.\r\n\r\nInstead, even the dummies contradict him. \u201cWhat?\u201d say the dummies, \u201ceverything is supposed to be in flux? But the timbers and the railings are over the river!\r\n\r\nOver the river everything is firm, all the values of things, the bridges, concepts, all \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018evil\u2019 \u2013 all of this is firm!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nBut when the hard winter comes, the beast tamer of rivers, then even the wittiest learn to mistrust, and, sure enough, then not only the dummies say: \u201cShould everything not \u2013 stand still?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBasically everything stands still\u201d \u2013 that is a real winter doctrine, a good thing for sterile times, a good comfort for hibernators and stove huggers.\r\n\r\n\u201cBasically everything stands still\u201d \u2013 but against this preaches the thaw wind!\r\n\r\nThe thaw wind, a bull that is no plowing bull \u2013 a raging bull, a destroyer that breaks ice with its wrathful horns! But ice \u2013 breaks footbridges!\r\n\r\nYes my brothers, is everything not now in flux? Have all railings and footbridges not fallen into the water? Who could still hang on to \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cevil\u201d?\r\n\r\n\u201cWoe to us! Hail to us! The thaw wind is blowing!\u201d \u2013 Preach me this, oh my brothers, in all the streets!\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nThere is an old delusion called good and evil. So far the wheel of this delusion has revolved around soothsayers and astrologers.\r\n\r\nOnce people believed in soothsayers and astrologers, and therefore they believed \u201cEverything is fate: you should, because you must!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen later people mistrusted all soothsayers and astrologers, and there- fore they believed \u201cEverything is freedom: you can, because you want to!\u201d\r\n\r\nYes, my brothers, so far we have merely deluded ourselves, but not known about the stars and the future, and therefore we have merely deluded ourselves, but not known about good and evil!\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\u201cThou shalt not rob! Thou shalt not kill!\u201d \u2013 such words were once held holy; before them one bent the knee, bowed the head and removed one\u2019s shoes.\r\n\r\nBut I ask you: where in the world have there ever been better robbers and killers than such holy words?\r\n\r\nIs there not in all life itself \u2013 robbing and killing? And for such words to have been called holy, was truth itself not \u2013 killed?\r\n\r\nOr was it a sermon of death that pronounced holy what contradicted and contravened all life? \u2013 Yes my brothers, break, break me the old tablets!\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nThis is my pity for everything past, that I see it is abandoned \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 abandoned to the favor, the spirit, the madness of each generation that comes along, and interprets everything that was as the bridge to itself!\r\n\r\nA great despot could come along, a shrewd monster, who with his favor and disfavor could force and forge the whole past, until it became a bridge to him, and omen and herald and harbinger.\r\n\r\nBut this is the other danger and my other pity: whoever is of the rabble, their remembrance goes no further back than their grandfather \u2013 and with their grandfather time ends.\r\n\r\nThus all the past is abandoned; because it could happen one day that the rabble would become ruler and in its shallow water all time would drown.\r\n\r\nTherefore, my brothers, we need a new nobility, which is the adversary of all rabble and all despotic rule and which writes anew the word \u201cnoble\u201d on new tablets.\r\n\r\nMany noble ones are needed, to be sure, and many kinds of noble ones for nobility to exist! Or, as I once spoke in parables: \u201cPrecisely that is godliness, that there are gods but no God!\u201d\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, I consecrate and conduct you to a new nobility: you shall be my begetters and growers and sowers of the future \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 to be sure, not to a nobility that you could buy like the shopkeepers and with shopkeepers\u2019 gold, for everything that has a price has little value.\r\n\r\nNot where you come from shall constitute your honor from now on, but instead where you are going! Your will and your foot, which wants to go over and beyond yourself \u2013 let that constitute your new honor!\r\n\r\nCertainly not that you served a prince \u2013 what do princes matter anymore! Or that you became a bulwark for what stands, to make it to stand more firmly!\r\n\r\nNot that your kinfolk became courtiers at court, and learned to stand long hours like a colorful flamingo in shallow ponds.\r\n\r\n\u2013 For being able to stand is a merit among courtiers; and all courtiers believe that part of blessedness after death is \u2013 being allowed to sit!\r\n\r\nNor that a spirit they called holy led your forefathers to promised lands, which I do not praise; because where the worst of all trees grew, the cross \u2013 there is nothing to praise about that land!\r\n\r\nAnd truly, wherever this \u201choly ghost\u201d led its knights, in such cru- sades goats and geese and pious crisscrossing contradictors ran in front !\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, your nobility should not look back, but out there! You should be exiles from all father- and forefatherlands!\r\n\r\nYou should love your children\u2019s land; let this love be your new nobility \u2013 the undiscovered land in the furthest sea! For that land I command your sails to seek and seek!\r\n\r\nYou should make it up in your children that you are the children of your fathers; thus you should redeem all that is past! This new tablet I place above you!\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy live? All is vain! Life \u2013 that is threshing straw; life \u2013 that is burning oneself and yet not getting warm.\u201d\r\n\r\nSuch archaic babble still passes for \u201cwisdom\u201d; but it is honored more highly because it smells old and musty. Even mustiness ennobles.\r\n\r\nChildren might speak like this: they fear fire because it burned them! There is much childishness in the old books of wisdom.\r\n\r\nAnd whoever is always \u201cthreshing straw,\u201d why should he be allowed to revile threshing? One really should muzzle such oxen!\r\n\r\nSuch people sit down at the table and bring nothing along, not even a good appetite \u2013 and now they revile saying \u201cAll is vain!\u201d\r\n\r\nBut eating and drinking well, my brothers, is really no vain art! Break, break me the tablets of the never-glad!\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\u201cTo the clean all is clean\u201d \u2013 that is what folks say. But I say to you: \u201cto swine all becomes swine!\u201d\r\n\r\nThis is why the rapturous and the head-hangers, whose hearts also hang down, preach: \u201cThe world itself is a filthy monster.\u201d\r\n\r\nBecause they are all unclean in spirit, especially those who have neither rest nor respite, unless they see the world from the hinter side \u2013 these hinterworldlings!\r\n\r\nTo their faces I say, even if it does not sound kind: the world resembles a human being in that it has a behind \u2013 that much is true!\r\n\r\nThere is much filth in the world: that much is true! But the world itself is not therefore a filthy monster!\r\n\r\nThere is wisdom in the fact that much in the world smells foul: nausea itself creates wings and water-divining powers!\r\n\r\nEven in the best there is something that nauseates; and the best is still something that must be overcome!\r\n\r\nYes my brothers, there is much wisdom in the fact that there is much filth in the world! \u2013\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nSuch sayings I heard the pious hinterworldlings speak to their conscience, and truly, without malice and falseness \u2013 even though there is nothing more false in the world, nor more malicious.\r\n\r\n\u201cJust let the world be the world! Do not lift so much as a finger against it!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIf someone wants to strangle and stab and slice and dice the people, let him; do not lift so much as a finger against it! That way they will yet learn to renounce the world.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd your own reason \u2013 this you yourself should smother and strangle, because it is a reason of this world \u2013 that way you yourself will learn to renounce the world.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 Break, break me these old tablets of the pious, my brothers! Gainsay me the sayings of the world slanderers!\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\u201cWhoever learns much, he forgets all vehement desire\u201d \u2013 today this is whispered throughout all dark lanes.\r\n\r\n\u201cWisdom makes weary, nothing is worth it; thou shalt not desire!\u201d \u2013 this new tablet I found hanging even in the open markets.\r\n\r\nBreak, my brothers, break me this new tablet too! The world-weary hung it there and the preachers of death, and the jailers as well; just look, it too is a sermon for slavery!\r\n\r\nThe reason they have such ruined stomachs is because they learned badly and not what was best, and everything too early and everything too fast; and they ate badly \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 you see, their spirit is a ruined stomach: it recommends death! Because truly, my brothers, the spirit is a stomach!\r\n\r\nLife is a well of joy; but for those out of whom the ruined stomach speaks, the father of gloom, all wells are poisoned.\r\n\r\nKnowing: that is joy to the lion-willed! But whoever has grown weary is himself merely being \u201cwilled,\u201d and all waves toss him around.\r\n\r\nAnd so it always is with weak willed persons; they lose themselves along the way. And finally their own weariness asks: \u201cWhy did we ever embark on ways! It\u2019s all the same!\u201d\r\n\r\nTo their ears it is music when they hear preached: \u201cNothing is worth it! You shall not will!\u201d But this is a sermon for slavery.\r\n\r\nYes my brothers, as a fresh roaring wind Zarathustra comes to all who are weary of their way; many noses he will yet make sneeze!\r\n\r\nMy free breath also blows through walls, and down into prisons and imprisoned spirits!\r\n\r\nWilling liberates because willing is creating: thus I teach. And you should learn only for creating!\r\n\r\nAnd even this learning you shall first learn from me, namely learning-well! \u2013 He who has ears to hear, let him hear!\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nThere sits the skiff \u2013 over there perhaps is the entryway to the great nothing. But who wants to board this \u201cperhaps\u201d?\r\n\r\nNone of you wants to board the death skiff! Then why do you want to be world-weary!\r\n\r\nWorld-weary! And you have not even become earth-alienated yet! I found you still lusting for the earth, still in love with your own earthly weariness!\r\n\r\nNot for nothing does your lip hang \u2013 a little earthly wish still sits on it! And in your eye \u2013 doesn\u2019t a little cloud of unforgotten earthly joy float there?\r\n\r\nThere are many good inventions on earth, some useful, others pleasant, for whose sake the earth is lovable.\r\n\r\nAnd some of what is there has been invented so well that it is like a woman\u2019s breasts: useful and pleasant at the same time.\r\n\r\nBut you world-weary! You earth-lazy! You should be flogged with switches! With floggings you should be made to step lively again.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if you are not misfits and moribund wretches of whom the earth is weary, then you are sly sloths or nibbling, creeping pleasure cats. And if you do not want to run again with gusto, then you should \u2013 pass away!\r\n\r\nOne should not try to be a physician for the incurable: thus Zarathustra teaches \u2013 and so you should pass away!\r\n\r\nBut it takes more courage to make an end than to make a new verse: that all physicians and poets know.\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, there are tablets created by weariness, and tablets created by rotten laziness; even though they talk the same, still they want to be heard differently.\r\n\r\nSee this languishing specimen here! He is merely one span away from his goal, but out of weariness he has laid himself defiantly here in the dust \u2013 this valiant man!\r\n\r\nOut of weariness he yawns at the road and the earth and the goal and himself; not one more step will he take \u2013 this valiant one!\r\n\r\nNow the sun burns on him and the dogs lick at his sweat; but he lies there in his defiance and would rather die of thirst \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 die of thirst one span away from his goal! Truly, you will yet have to drag him to his heaven by the hair \u2013 this hero!\r\n\r\nBetter still, just let him lie where he has laid himself so that sleep can come to him, the comforter, with its cooling rushing rain:\r\n\r\nLet him lie until he awakens on his own \u2013 until he renounces all weariness on his own and whatever weariness taught through him!\r\n\r\nOnly, my brothers, chase the dogs away from him, the lazy creepers and the whole raving rout \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 the whole raving rout of \u201cthe educated\u201d that feasts on the sweat of every hero!\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nI draw circles around me and sacred borders; ever fewer climb with me on ever higher mountains \u2013 I build a range of mountains out of ever more sacred mountains.\r\n\r\nBut wherever you may climb with me, my brothers, see to it that a parasite does not climb with you!\r\n\r\nParasite: that is a worm, a crawling writhing worm that wants to glut itself on your infected nicks and niches.\r\n\r\nAnd its art consists in guessing where climbing souls are weary; in your grief and dismay, in your tender modesty it builds its disgusting nest.\r\n\r\nWhere the strong is weak, the noble one all too mild \u2013 in that place it builds its disgusting nest; the parasite lives where the great person has little nicks and niches.\r\n\r\nWhat is the highest species of all being and what is the least? The parasite is the least of species, but whoever is of the highest species nourishes the most parasites.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the soul that has the longest ladder and reaches down farthest \u2013 how could it not have the most parasites clinging to it?\r\n\r\nThe most encompassing soul, which can run and stray and roam farthest within itself; the most necessary soul, which out of joy plunges itself into chance \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 the soul that loves being, but submerges into becoming; the having soul that wants to rise to willing and desiring \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 the soul that flees itself and catches up to itself in the widest circle; the wisest soul which folly persuades most sweetly \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 the one that loves itself most, in which all things have their current and recurrent and ebb and flow \u2013 indeed, how could the highest soul not have the worst parasites?\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, am I perhaps cruel? But I say: if something is falling, one should also give it a push!\r\n\r\nEverything of today \u2013 it is falling, it is failing: who would want to stop it! But I \u2013 I want to push it too!\r\n\r\nDo you know the kind of lust that rolls stones down into steep depths? \u2013 These people of today; just look at how they roll into my depths!\r\n\r\nI am a prelude of better players, my brothers! An exemplary play! Act according to my example!\r\n\r\nAnd whomever you cannot teach to fly, him you should teach \u2013 to fall faster!\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nI love the valiant, but it is not enough to be a fierce combatant \u2013 one must also know whom to combat!\r\n\r\nAnd often there is more valiance in someone controlling himself and passing by, so that he saves himself for the worthier enemy!\r\n\r\nYou should have only those enemies whom you hate, but not enemies to despise; you must be proud of your enemy: this I taught you already once before.\r\n\r\nFor the worthier enemy, my friends, you should save yourselves, and therefore you must pass by much \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 especially pass by much rabble that thunders in your ears about folk and peoples.\r\n\r\nKeep your eye clear of their pros and cons! There is much justice, much injustice here; whoever watches becomes angry.\r\n\r\nLook around, beat them down \u2013 it\u2019s all the same here; therefore go away into the woods and lay your swords to sleep!\r\n\r\nGo your ways! And let folk and peoples go theirs! \u2013 dark ways, to be sure, on which not a single hope flashes anymore!\r\n\r\nLet the shopkeeper rule where all that is left to glitter \u2013 is shopkeepers\u2019 gold! The time of kings is no more; what calls itself a people today deserves no kings.\r\n\r\nJust look at how these peoples themselves do the same as the shopkeepers; they pluck themselves the tiniest advantage from any dustpan!\r\n\r\nThey lie in wait for one another, they look in hate at one another \u2013 this they call \u201cgood neighbors.\u201d Oh happy distant time when a people said to themselves: \u201cI want to be ruler over peoples!\u201d\r\n\r\nFor the best should rule, my brothers, and the best also want to rule! And wherever the teaching says differently, there \u2013 the best are missing.\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nIf they had bread for free, oh no! What would they clamor for! Their sustainment \u2013 that is their real entertainment, and they should have it hard!\r\n\r\nThey are beasts of prey: in their \u201cworking\u201d \u2013 preying is there too; in their \u201cearning\u201d \u2013 outwitting is there too! Therefore they should have it hard!\r\n\r\nThey should become better beasts of prey, more subtle, more clever, more human-like: the human being, after all, is the best beast of prey.\r\n\r\nHuman beings have already successfully preyed upon the virtues of all animals; this is because human beings have had the hardest time of all animals.\r\n\r\nOnly the birds are above him. And if human beings were to learn even to fly, watch out! How high \u2013 would his lust to prey fly!\r\n\r\n23\r\n\r\nThis is how I want man and woman: fit for war the one, fit for bearing children the other, but both fit to dance in head and limb.\r\n\r\nAnd let each day be a loss to us on which we did not dance once! And let each truth be false to us which was not greeted by one laugh!\r\n\r\n24\r\n\r\nIn taking your wedding vows \u2013 see to it that you are not making your bedding vows. Vowing too quickly results in \u2013 breaking vows! And better vow breaking than vow bending and vow pretending! A woman once said to me: \u201cSure, I broke my wedding vows, but first my wedding vows broke \u2013 me!\u201d\r\n\r\nThe worst of the vengeful I always found to be the mismatched couples: they take it out on the whole world that they are no longer singles.\r\n\r\nThis is why I want honest people to speak honestly to one another: \u201cWe love each other; let us see to it that we keep loving each other! Or did we promise by mistake?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cGive us a trial period and a small marriage, so that we can see whether we are fit for a big marriage! It is a big thing to always be in twos!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus I counsel all honest people; and what then would my love for the overman be, and for everything else that is to come, if I counseled and conveyed otherwise!\r\n\r\nNot merely to reproduce, but instead to surproduce \u2013 to that goal, my brothers, may the garden of marriage help you!\r\n\r\n25\r\n\r\nWhoever has become wise about ancient origins will surely, in the end, seek new wells of the future and new origins.\r\n\r\nYes my brothers, it will not be overly long and new peoples will originate and new wells will roar down into new depths.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake, after all \u2013 it buries many wells, it causes much dying of thirst: it also brings to light inner powers and secrets.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake reveals new wells. In an earthquake of ancient peoples new wells break out.\r\n\r\nAnd whoever cries out there: \u201cLook, here is a fountain for many who thirst, a heart for many who long, a will for many tools\u201d \u2013 around him gathers a people, that is: many who try.\r\n\r\nWho can command, who must obey \u2013 here it is tried! Indeed, with what long searching and guessing and lack of success and learning and trying again!\r\n\r\nHuman society: it is an experiment, this I teach \u2013 a long search: but it searches for the commander! \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 an experiment, oh my brothers! And not a \u201ccontract!\u201d Break, break me such words of the soft hearted and half-and-halfs!\r\n\r\n26\r\n\r\nMy brothers! In whom does the greatest danger lie for all of future humanity? Is it not in the good and the just?\r\n\r\n\u2013 is it not in those who speak and feel in their hearts: \u201cWe already know what is good and just, and we have it too; woe to any who still search here!\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd whatever harm the evil may do, the harm of the good is the most harmful harm!\r\n\r\nAnd whatever harm the world slanderers may do, the harm of the good is the most harmful harm!\r\n\r\nMy brothers, there was a man who once looked into the hearts of the good and the just, and he spoke: \u201cThey are pharisees.\u201d But he was not understood.\r\n\r\nThe good and the just themselves were not permitted to understand him: their spirit is imprisoned in their good conscience. The stupidity of the good is unfathomably clever.\r\n\r\nBut this is the truth: the good must be pharisees \u2013 they have no choice!\r\n\r\nThe good must crucify the one who invents his own virtue! This is the truth!\r\n\r\nThe second one, however, who discovered their land, the land, hearts and soil of the good and just: he was the one who asked: \u201cWhom do they hate the most?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe creator they hate the most; he who breaks tablets and old values, the breaker \u2013 him they call the lawbreaker.\r\n\r\nBecause the good, you see \u2013 they can not create: they are always the beginning of the end \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 they crucify the one who writes new values on new tablets, they sacrifice the future to themselves \u2013 they crucify all future huma- nity!\r\n\r\nThe good \u2013 they were always the beginning of the end. \u2013\r\n\r\n27\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, have you even understood these words? And what I once said about the \u201clast human being?\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nIn whom does the greatest danger lie for all of future humanity? Is it not in the good and the just?\r\n\r\nBreak, break me the good and the just! \u2013 Oh my brothers, have you even understood these words?\r\n\r\n28\r\n\r\nYou flee from me? You are frightened? You tremble before these words?\r\n\r\nMy brothers, when I told you to break the good and the tablets of the good, then for the first time I launched mankind onto their high seas.\r\n\r\nAnd only now the great fright comes to them, the great looking-around oneself, the great sickness, the great nausea, the great seasickness.\r\n\r\nFalse coasts and false securities were taught you by the good; in the lies of the good you were born and bielded. Everything has been duplicitous and twisted from the ground up by the good.\r\n\r\nBut whoever discovered the land \u201chuman being\u201d also discovered the land \u201chuman future.\u201d Now you will be seafarers, brave and patient!\r\n\r\nWalk upright for once, my brothers, learn to walk upright! The sea is stormy: Many want to right themselves again on you.\r\n\r\nThe sea is stormy: Everything is in the sea. Well then! Well now! You old salts!\r\n\r\nWhat fatherland! There our helm wants to steer, where our children\u2019s land is! Out there, stormier than the sea, storms our great longing! \u2013\r\n\r\n29\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy so hard!\u201d \u2013 the kitchen coal once said to the diamond. \u201cAre we not close relatives?\u201d\r\n\r\nWhy so soft? Oh my brothers, this I ask you: for are you not \u2013 my brothers?\r\n\r\nWhy so soft, so retiring and yielding? Why is there so much denying and denial in your hearts? And so little destiny in your gazes?\r\n\r\nAnd if you do not want to be destinies and inexorable, how could you triumph with me?\r\n\r\nAnd if your hardness does not want to flash and undo and cut through, how could you one day create with me?\r\n\r\nThe creators are hard after all. And it must seem like bliss to you to press your hand upon millennia as if upon wax \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 bliss to write upon the will of millennia as if upon bronze \u2013 harder than bronze, more noble than bronze. Only the most noble is perfectly hard.\r\n\r\nThis new tablet, my brothers, I place above you: become hard! \u2013\r\n\r\n30\r\n\r\nOh you my will! You turning point of all need, you point of my necessity! Preserve me from all small victories!\r\n\r\nYou ordaining of my soul, that I call destiny! You in-me, over-me! Preserve and save me for a great destiny!\r\n\r\nAnd your ultimate greatness, my will, save that for your ultimate \u2013 that you be inexorable in your victory! Indeed, who was not defeated in his victory!\r\n\r\nIndeed, whose eye did not darken in this drunken twilight! Indeed, whose foot did not stagger and forget how to stand in victory!\r\n\r\n\u2013 That I may one day be ready and ripe in the great noon; ready and ripe like glowing bronze, clouds pregnant with lightning and swelling udders of milk \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 ready for myself and for my most hidden will; a bow burning for its arrow, an arrow burning for its star \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 a star ready and ripe in its noon, glowing, skewered, blissful with annihilating arrows of the sun \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 a sun itself and an inexorable will of the sun, ready for annihilating in victory!\r\n\r\nOh will, turning point of all need, you my point of necessity! Save me for a great victory! \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 73}, {"data": {"uuid": "0e7f6615-3a34-4e60-93ab-1b5f39d6089f", "user": 1, "title": "The Convalescent", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:56:52.816393+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:56:52.838987+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Convalescent</h2><h3>1</h3><p>One morning not long after his return to his cave, Zarathustra sprang from his bed like a madman, screamed with a terrifying voice and behaved as though someone else were lying on his bed, who did not want to get up. And Zarathustra\u2019s voice reverberated so much that his animals rushed to him frightened, and from every cave and hiding place neighboring on Zarathustra\u2019s cave, all the animals scurried away \u2013 flying, fluttering, crawling, leaping in whatever manner of foot or feather they were given. But Zarathustra said these words:</p><p>Up, abysmal thought, out of my depths! I am your rooster and dawn, you sleepy worm: up! Up! My voice will yet crow you awake!</p><p>Unsnap the straps of your ears: listen! Because I want to hear you! Up! Up! Here there is thunder enough to make even graves learn to listen!</p><p>And wipe the sleep and all that befogs and blinds you from your eyes! Hear me with your eyes too: my voice is a remedy even for those born blind.</p><p>And once you are awake, you shall remain awake eternally. It is not my manner to wake great-grandmothers from their sleep only to tell them \u2013 go back to sleep!</p><p>You stir, you stretch, you gasp? Up! Up! No gasping \u2013 you will speak to me! Zarathustra summons you, the godless one!</p><p>I, Zarathustra, the advocate of life, the advocate of suffering, the advocate of the circle \u2013 you I summon, my most abysmal thought!</p><p>Hail to me! You are coming \u2013 I hear you! My abyss speaks, I have unfolded my ultimate depth to the light!</p><p>Hail to me! Here now! Give me your hand \u2013 ha! Let go! Haha! \u2013 Nausea, nausea, nausea \u2013 oh no!</p><h3>2</h3><p>Scarcely had he spoken these words, however, when Zarathustra collapsed like a dead man and long remained as if dead. But when he came to he was pale and he trembled, still lying down, and for a long time he wanted neither to eat nor drink. This behavior lasted seven days; meanwhile, his animals did not leave his side day and night, unless the eagle flew out to fetch food. And whatever prey it fetched together it laid on Zarathustra\u2019s bed until eventually Zarathustra lay among yellow and red berries, grapes, red apples, aromatic herbs and pine cones. At his feet, however, two lambs were spread out, which the eagle with difficulty had taken as prey from their shepherds.</p><p>Finally, after seven days, Zarathustra sat up on his bed, picked up one of the red apples, smelled it, and found its aroma lovely. Then his animals believed the time had come to speak with him.</p><p>\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d they said. \u201cNow you have been lying like this for seven days, with heavy eyes: do you not want at last to get on your feet?</p><p>Step out of your cave: the world awaits you like a garden. The wind is playing with heady fragrances that make their way to you; and all brooks want to run after you.</p><p>All things long for you, while you have stayed alone for seven days \u2013 step out of your cave! All things want to be your physician!</p><p>Did perhaps some new knowledge come to you, something sour, heavy? You lay there like leavened dough, your soul rose up and swelled over all its rims. \u2013\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cOh my animals,\u201d answered Zarathustra. \u201cJust keep babbling and let me listen! It invigorates me so when you babble: where there is babbling the world indeed lies before me like a garden.</p><p>How lovely it is that there are words and sounds; aren\u2019t words and sounds rainbows and illusory bridges between things eternally separated?</p><p>To each soul belongs another world; for each soul every other soul is a hinterworld.</p><p>Illusion tells its loveliest lies about the things that are most similar, because the tiniest gap is hardest to bridge.</p><p>For me \u2013 how would there be something outside me? There is no outside! But we forget this with all sounds; how lovely it is that we forget!</p><p>Have names and sounds not been bestowed on things so that human beings can invigorate themselves on things? It is a beautiful folly, speaking: with it humans dance over all things.</p><p>How lovely is all talking and all lying of sounds! With sounds our love dances on colorful rainbows.\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u2013 \u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d said the animals then. \u201cTo those who think as we do, all things themselves approach dancing; they come and reach out their hands and laugh and retreat \u2013 and come back.</p><p>Everything goes, everything comes back; the wheel of being rolls eternally. Everything dies, everything blossoms again, the year of being runs eternally.</p><p>Everything breaks, everything is joined anew; the same house of being builds itself eternally. Everything parts, everything greets itself again; the ring of being remains loyal to itself eternally.</p><p>In every Instant being begins; around every Here rolls the ball There. The middle is everywhere. Crooked is the path of eternity.\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u2013 \u201cOh you foolish rascals and barrel organs!\u201d answered Zarathustra, smiling again. \u201cHow well you know what had to come true in seven days \u2013</p><p>\u2013 and how that monster crawled into my throat and choked me! But I bit off its head and spat it away from me.</p><p>And you \u2013 you have already made a hurdy-gurdy song of it? Now I lie here, weary still from this biting and spitting out, sick still from my own redemption.</p><p>And you looked on at all of this? Oh my animals, are you also cruel? Did you want to watch my great pain the way people do? For human beings are the cruelest animal.</p><p>Tragic plays, bullfights and crucifixions have always made them feel best on earth; and when they invented hell for themselves, see here \u2013 it was their heaven on earth.</p><p>When a great human being cries out \u2013 in a flash the little ones come running, and their tongues hang out with lasciviousness. But they call it their \u2018pity.\u2019</p><p>The little human being, especially the poet \u2013 how eagerly he puts his accusations against life into words! Hear him, but do not fail to hear the lust that is in all his accusing!</p><p>Such accusers of life are overcome by life in a blink of an eye. \u2018You love me?\u2019 says the flirt. \u2018Wait just a while longer, I don\u2019t have time for you yet.\u2019</p><p>The human being is the cruelest animal against itself; and with all those who call themselves \u2018sinner\u2019 and \u2018cross bearer\u2019 and \u2018penitent,\u2019 do not fail to hear the lust in such complaining and accusing!</p><p>And I myself \u2013 do I want therefore to be the accuser of mankind? Oh my animals, this alone have I learned so far, that for mankind their most evil is necessary for their best \u2013</p><p>\u2013 that whatever is most evil is their best power and the hardest stone for the highest creator; and that mankind must become better and more evil \u2013</p><p>The cross on which I suffered was not that I know human beings are evil \u2013 instead, I cried as no one yet has cried:</p><p>\u2018A shame that their most evil is so very small! A shame that their best is so very small!\u2019</p><p>My great surfeit of human beings \u2013 that choked me and crawled into my throat; and what the soothsayer said: \u2018All is the same, nothing is worth it, knowledge chokes.\u2019</p><p>A long twilight limped ahead of me, a tired to death and drunk to death sadness that spoke with a yawning mouth:</p><p>\u2018Eternally he returns, the human of whom you are weary, the small human being\u2019 \u2013 thus my sadness yawned and dragged its foot and could not fall asleep.</p><p>For me the human earth transformed into a cave, its chest caved in; everything living became human mold and bones and crumbling past.</p><p>My sighing sat upon all human graves and could no longer stand up; my sighing and questioning croaked and choked and gnashed and lashed day and night:</p><p>\u2013 \u2018alas, human beings recur eternally! The small human beings recur eternally!\u2019 \u2013</p><p>Naked I once saw them both, the greatest human and the smallest human: all too similar to one another \u2013 all too human still even the greatest one!</p><p>All too small the greatest one! That was my surfeit of humans! And eternal recurrence of even the smallest! \u2013 That was my surfeit of all existence!</p><p>Oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea!\u201d \u2013 Thus spoke Zarathustra and sighed and shuddered, because he remembered his sickness. But his animals did not allow him to continue.</p><p>\u201cSpeak no more, you convalescent!\u201d \u2013 answered his animals. \u201cRather go outside where the world awaits you like a garden.</p><p>Go outside to the roses and bees and swarms of doves! Especially to the song birds, so that you can learn to sing from them!</p><p>Singing after all is for convalescents, let the healthy person talk. And even if the healthy person also wants songs, he wants different songs than the convalescent.\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cOh you foolish rascals and barrel organs, shut up!\u201d \u2013 answered Zarathustra, and he smiled at his animals. \u201cHow well you know which comfort I invented for myself in seven days!</p><p>That I must sing once again \u2013 this comfort I invented for myself and this convalescence; but do you want to make that into a hurdy-gurdy song right away too?\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cSpeak no more,\u201d answered his animals again. \u201cInstead, you convalescent, fashion yourself a lyre first, a new lyre!</p><p>Behold oh Zarathustra! For your new songs new lyres are needed.</p><p>Sing and foam over, Zarathustra; heal your soul with new songs so that you can bear your great destiny, which was never before a human\u2019s destiny!</p><p>For your animals know well, oh Zarathustra, who you are and must become; behold, you are the teacher of the eternal recurrence \u2013 that now is your destiny!</p><p>That you must teach this teaching as the first \u2013 how could this great destiny not also be your greatest danger and sickness!</p><p>Behold, we know what you teach: that all things recur eternally and we ourselves along with them, and that we have already been here times eternal and all things along with us.</p><p>You teach that there is a great year of becoming, a monster of a great year; like an hourglass it must turn itself over anew, again and again, so that it runs down and runs out anew \u2013</p><p>\u2013 so that all these years are the same as each other, in what is greatest and also in what is smallest \u2013 so that we ourselves in every great year are the same, in what is greatest and also in what is smallest.</p><p>And if you wanted to die now, oh Zarathustra: behold, we know too how you would speak to yourself then: \u2013 but your animals beg you not to die yet!</p><p>You would speak and without trembling, rather taking a deep breath, blissfully; for a great weight and oppressiveness would be taken from you, you most patient one!</p><p>\u2018Now I die and disappear,\u2019 you would say, \u2018and in an instant I will be a nothing.

And even if the healthy person also wants songs, he wants different songs than the convalescent.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cOh you foolish rascals and barrel organs, shut up!\u201d \u2013 answered Zarathustra, and he smiled at his animals. \u201cHow well you know which comfort I invented for myself in seven days!\r\n\r\nThat I must sing once again \u2013 this comfort I invented for myself and this convalescence; but do you want to make that into a hurdy-gurdy song right away too?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cSpeak no more,\u201d answered his animals again. \u201cInstead, you convalescent, fashion yourself a lyre first, a new lyre!\r\n\r\nBehold oh Zarathustra! For your new songs new lyres are needed.\r\n\r\nSing and foam over, Zarathustra; heal your soul with new songs so that you can bear your great destiny, which was never before a human\u2019s destiny!\r\n\r\nFor your animals know well, oh Zarathustra, who you are and must become; behold, you are the teacher of the eternal recurrence \u2013 that now is your destiny!\r\n\r\nThat you must teach this teaching as the first \u2013 how could this great destiny not also be your greatest danger and sickness!\r\n\r\nBehold, we know what you teach: that all things recur eternally and we ourselves along with them, and that we have already been here times eternal and all things along with us.\r\n\r\nYou teach that there is a great year of becoming, a monster of a great year; like an hourglass it must turn itself over anew, again and again, so that it runs down and runs out anew \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 so that all these years are the same as each other, in what is greatest and also in what is smallest \u2013 so that we ourselves in every great year are the same, in what is greatest and also in what is smallest.\r\n\r\nAnd if you wanted to die now, oh Zarathustra: behold, we know too how you would speak to yourself then: \u2013 but your animals beg you not to die yet!\r\n\r\nYou would speak and without trembling, rather taking a deep breath, blissfully; for a great weight and oppressiveness would be taken from you, you most patient one!\r\n\r\n\u2018Now I die and disappear,\u2019 you would say, \u2018and in an instant I will be a nothing. Souls are as mortal as bodies.\r\n\r\nBut the knot of causes in which I am entangled recurs \u2013 it will create me again! I myself belong to the causes of the eternal recurrence.\r\n\r\nI will return, with this sun, with this earth, with this eagle, with this snake \u2013 not to a new life or a better life or a similar life:\r\n\r\n\u2013 I will return to this same and selfsame life, in what is greatest as well as in what is smallest, to once again teach the eternal recurrence of all things \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 to once again speak the word about the great earth of noon and human beings, to once again proclaim the overman to mankind.\r\n\r\nI spoke my word, I break under my word: thus my eternal fate wills it \u2013 as proclaimer I perish!\r\n\r\nThe hour has now come for the one who goes under to bless himself. Thus \u2013 ends Zarathustra\u2019s going under!\u2019\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nWhen the animals had spoken these words they fell silent and waited for Zarathustra to say something to them: but Zarathustra did not hear that they were silent. Instead he lay still, with eyes closed, like someone sleeping \u2013 even though he was not sleeping. Indeed, at this moment he was conversing with his soul. The snake and the eagle, however, finding him silent in this manner, honored the great stillness around him and cautiously slipped away."}, "id": 74}, {"data": {"uuid": "6052493d-db6b-4b85-a0c7-e9e027fbec0d", "user": 1, "title": "On Great Longing", "created_on": "2023-05-10 15:57:32.890858+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 15:57:32.910642+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>On Great Longing</h2><p>Oh my soul, I taught you to say \u201ctoday\u201d and \u201conce\u201d and \u201cformerly,\u201d and to dance your round over all here and then and there.</p><p>Oh my soul, I redeemed you from all nooks, I swept dust, spiders and twilight off of you.</p><p>Oh my soul, I washed the petty bashfulness and the nook-virtue from you and persuaded you to stand naked before the eyes of the sun.</p><p>With the storm called \u201cspirit\u201d I blew over your choppy sea; I blew all clouds away, I even choked the choker who is called \u201csin.\u201d</p><p>Oh my soul, I gave you the right to say no like the storm and to say yes as the open sky says yes: still as light you now stand and even if you pass through storms of denial.</p><p>Oh my soul, I gave you back your freedom over what is created and uncreated: and who knows as you know the lust of future things?</p><p>Oh my soul, I taught you contempt that does not come like a gnawing worm, the great, loving contempt that loves most where it has the most contempt.</p><p>Oh my soul, I taught you to persuade such that you persuade even the grounds; like the sun that persuades even the sea into its heights.</p><p>Oh my soul, I took from you all obeying, knee-bending and sir-saying; I myself gave you the name \u201cturning point of need\u201d and \u201cdestiny.\u201d</p><p>Oh my soul, I gave you new names and colorful playthings, I called you \u201cdestiny\u201d and \u201ccompass of compasses\u201d and \u201cumbilical cord of time\u201d and \u201cazure bell.\u201d</p><p>Oh my soul, to your soil I gave all wisdom to drink, all new wines and also all old strong wines of wisdom from time immemorial.</p><p>Oh my soul, I poured every sun upon you and every night and every silence and every longing \u2013 then you grew up for me like a grapevine.</p><p>Oh my soul, super-rich and heavy you stand there now, a grapevine with swelling udders and crowded, brownish gold grapes \u2013</p><p>\u2013 crowded and crushed by your happiness, waiting out of superabun- dance and even bashful because of your waiting.</p><p>Oh my soul, nowhere now is there a soul that could be more loving and more compassing and encompassing!

Because know this: I want to offer the honey sacrifice up there.\u201d \u2013</p><p>But when Zarathustra was up on the summit he sent home the animals which had accompanied him, and he found that he was alone now \u2013 then he laughed with his whole heart, looked around and spoke thus:</p><p>That I spoke of sacrifices and honey sacrifices was merely a sleight of speech and, truly, a useful folly! Up here I may speak more freely than before hermits\u2019 caves and hermits\u2019 pets.</p><p>What sacrifice! I squander what was bestowed me, I the squanderer with a thousand hands: How could I call that \u2013 sacrificing!</p><p>And when I desired honey I merely desired bait and sweet ooze and mucus, for which even growling bears and odd, surly, evil birds lick with their tongues:</p><p>\u2013 the best bait, as it is needed by hunters and fishermen. Because if the world is like a dark jungle and a pleasure garden for all wild hunters, to me it seems even more, and preferably, an abysmal rich sea,</p><p>\u2013 a sea full of colorful fishes and crabs, for whose sake even gods would crave to become fishermen and net casters: so rich is the world in odd things great and small!</p><p>Especially the human world, the human sea \u2013 toward it I now cast my golden fishing rod and say: open up, you human abyss!</p><p>Open up and toss me your fishes and glittering crabs! With my best bait today I bait the oddest human fishes!</p><p>\u2013 my very happiness I cast far and wide, between sunrise, noon and sunset, to see if many human fishes learn to jiggle and wiggle on my happiness.</p><p>Until, biting on my sharp hidden hooks, they have to emerge into my height, the motliest gorge gudgeons to the most spiteful of all fishers of human fish.</p><p>That\u2019s what I am, after all, at bottom and from the start; reeling, reeling in, raising up, raising, a raiser, a cultivator and taskmaster who not for nothing once told himself: \u201cBecome who you are!\u201d</p><p>So now human beings may come up to me; you see, I am still waiting for the sign that it is time for my descent; I myself will not go under yet, as I must, and among human beings.</p><p>That\u2019s why I\u2019m waiting here, cunning and mocking on high mountains, not impatient, not patient, but instead one who has forgotten even forbearance \u2013 because he no longer \u201cbears.\u201d</p><p>My destiny leaves me time for this: surely it has forgotten me? Or does it sit behind a big rock in the shade, catching flies?</p><p>And really, I like my eternal destiny for not rushing and pressing me and for leaving me time for jests and spite, so that today I climbed this high mountain to catch fish.</p><p>Did a human being ever catch fish on high mountains? And even if what I want and do up here is folly, this is still better than becoming pompous and green and gold down there from waiting \u2013</p><p>\u2013 a swaggering wrath snorter from waiting, a holy, howling mountain storm, an impatient one who cries down into the valleys: \u201cHear me, or I shall whip you with the lash of God!\u201d</p><p>Not that I would grudge such angry men for it; they are good enough for me to laugh at! They have to be impatient anyway, these big noisy drums, who either get to speak today or never!</p><p>But I and my destiny \u2013 we do not speak to today, nor do we speak to never: we have patience enough and time and overtime for speaking. Because it must come someday and may not pass by.</p><p>What must come someday and may not pass by? Our great Hazar, that is our great distant human empire, the Zarathustra empire of a thousand years \u2013</p><p>How distant might such a \u201cdistance\u201d be? What do I care! But it is no less firm to me on that account \u2013 with both feet I stand firmly on this ground,</p><p>\u2013 on an eternal ground, on hard primeval rock, on this highest, hardest primeval mountain chain, to which all winds come as if to a weathershed, asking Where? and from Where? and Where to?</p><p>Laugh, laugh here my bright hearty spite! Throw down your glittering, mocking laughter from high mountains! Bait me the most beautiful human fish with your glittering!</p><p>And whatever in all the seas belongs to me, my actual me in all things \u2013 fish that out for me, bring that up to me \u2013 that\u2019s what I am waiting for, I the most spiteful of all fishermen.</p><p>Out, out my fishing rod! Into and down, bait of my happiness! Drip your sweetest dew, my heart\u2019s honey! Bite, my fishing rod, into the belly of all black gloom!</p><p>Out there, out there my eye!

One day as he sat on a stone before his cave and gazed outward \u2013 there where one looks out upon the sea and beyond twisting abysses \u2013 his animals walked around him pensively until finally they stood before him.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d they said. \u201cAre you perhaps on the lookout for your happiness?\u201d \u2013 \u201cWhat does happiness matter!\u201d he answered. \u201cI haven\u2019t strived for happiness for a long time, I strive for my work.\u201d \u2013 \u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d said the animals again. \u201cYou say that as one who has had overly much of the good. Do you not lie in a sky-blue lake of happiness?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cYou foolish rascals,\u201d answered Zarathustra, smiling. \u201cHow well you chose your metaphor! But you also know that my happiness is heavy and not like a fluid wave of water; it presses me and will not leave me alone and it acts like melted tar.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThen the animals again walked around him pensively and once more they stood before him. \u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d they said, \u201cis that why you yourself are becoming ever yellower and darker, even though your hair looks white and flaxen? Don\u2019t you see, you are bogged down in your misfortune!\u201d \u2013 \u201cWhat are you saying, my animals?\u201d said Zarathustra, and he laughed. \u201cTruly, I smeared when I used the word tar. What\u2019s happening to me is common to all fruits that ripen. It\u2019s the honey in my veins that makes my blood thicker and also makes my soul calmer.\u201d \u2013 \u201cIt will be as you say, oh Zarathustra,\u201d answered the animals, and they pressed up against him. \u201cBut do you not want to climb a high mountain today? The air is pure and today one sees more of the world than ever before.\u201d \u2013 \u201cYes, my animals,\u201d he answered. \u201cYour advice is superb and after my own heart: I do want to climb a high mountain today! But see to it that there is honey at hand for me there; yellow, white, good, icy fresh golden honey from the comb. Because know this: I want to offer the honey sacrifice up there.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nBut when Zarathustra was up on the summit he sent home the animals which had accompanied him, and he found that he was alone now \u2013 then he laughed with his whole heart, looked around and spoke thus:\r\n\r\nThat I spoke of sacrifices and honey sacrifices was merely a sleight of speech and, truly, a useful folly! Up here I may speak more freely than before hermits\u2019 caves and hermits\u2019 pets.\r\n\r\nWhat sacrifice! I squander what was bestowed me, I the squanderer with a thousand hands: How could I call that \u2013 sacrificing!\r\n\r\nAnd when I desired honey I merely desired bait and sweet ooze and mucus, for which even growling bears and odd, surly, evil birds lick with their tongues:\r\n\r\n\u2013 the best bait, as it is needed by hunters and fishermen. Because if the world is like a dark jungle and a pleasure garden for all wild hunters, to me it seems even more, and preferably, an abysmal rich sea,\r\n\r\n\u2013 a sea full of colorful fishes and crabs, for whose sake even gods would crave to become fishermen and net casters: so rich is the world in odd things great and small!\r\n\r\nEspecially the human world, the human sea \u2013 toward it I now cast my golden fishing rod and say: open up, you human abyss!\r\n\r\nOpen up and toss me your fishes and glittering crabs! With my best bait today I bait the oddest human fishes!\r\n\r\n\u2013 my very happiness I cast far and wide, between sunrise, noon and sunset, to see if many human fishes learn to jiggle and wiggle on my happiness.\r\n\r\nUntil, biting on my sharp hidden hooks, they have to emerge into my height, the motliest gorge gudgeons to the most spiteful of all fishers of human fish.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s what I am, after all, at bottom and from the start; reeling, reeling in, raising up, raising, a raiser, a cultivator and taskmaster who not for nothing once told himself: \u201cBecome who you are!\u201d\r\n\r\nSo now human beings may come up to me; you see, I am still waiting for the sign that it is time for my descent; I myself will not go under yet, as I must, and among human beings.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m waiting here, cunning and mocking on high mountains, not impatient, not patient, but instead one who has forgotten even forbearance \u2013 because he no longer \u201cbears.\u201d\r\n\r\nMy destiny leaves me time for this: surely it has forgotten me? Or does it sit behind a big rock in the shade, catching flies?\r\n\r\nAnd really, I like my eternal destiny for not rushing and pressing me and for leaving me time for jests and spite, so that today I climbed this high mountain to catch fish.\r\n\r\nDid a human being ever catch fish on high mountains? And even if what I want and do up here is folly, this is still better than becoming pompous and green and gold down there from waiting \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 a swaggering wrath snorter from waiting, a holy, howling mountain storm, an impatient one who cries down into the valleys: \u201cHear me, or I shall whip you with the lash of God!\u201d\r\n\r\nNot that I would grudge such angry men for it; they are good enough for me to laugh at!

But as he sat there like this, with a stick in his hand and tracing the outline of his shadow on the ground, reflecting and, truly, not about himself and his shadow \u2013 then all at once he was frightened and startled, because next to his own shadow he saw another shadow.

My final sin, the one saved up for me \u2013 do you know what it\u2019s called?\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cPity!\u201d answered the soothsayer from his overflowing heart, and he raised both hands high \u2013 \u201coh Zarathustra, I come to seduce you to your last sin!\u201d \u2013</p><p>And scarcely had these words been spoken when the cry rang out again, and longer and more anxious than before, also much closer now. \u201cDo you hear? Do you hear, oh Zarathustra?\u201d cried the soothsayer. \u201cThe cry is meant for you, it calls you: come, come, come, it is time, it is high time!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Zarathustra was silent after this, confused and shaken; finally he asked, like one who hesitates inwardly: \u201cAnd who is it there that calls me?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut you know it already,\u201d answered the soothsayer vehemently. \u201cWhy do you conceal yourself? It is the higher man who calls for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe higher man?\u201d cried Zarathustra, seized by horror. \u201cWhat does he want? What does he want? The higher man! What does he want here?\u201d \u2013 And his skin was bathed in sweat.</p><p>But the soothsayer did not respond to Zarathustra\u2019s fear, and instead he listened and listened toward the depths. But after it was quiet there for a long time, he turned his glance back and saw Zarathustra standing and trembling.</p><p>\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d he began with a sad voice. \u201cYou do not stand there like one whose happiness makes him giddy: you will have to dance to keep from falling down!</p><p>But even if you were to dance before me and leap all your side-leaps, no one should be allowed to tell me: \u2018Look, here dances the last gay human being!\u2019</p><p>Anyone who came to this height looking for him would come in vain; caves he would find, to be sure, and hinter-caves, hiding places for hiders, but no shafts of happiness and treasure chambers and new golden veins of happiness.</p><p>Happiness \u2013 how could anyone find happiness among those who are buried away and hermits? Must I seek the last happiness far away on blessed isles between forgotten seas?</p><p>But all is the same, nothing is worth it, searching does not help, and there are no blessed isles anymore!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Thus sighed the soothsayer; but at his last sigh Zarathustra became bright and certain once more, like someone who comes from a deep chasm into the light. \u201cNo! No! No! Three times no!\u201d he cried in a strong voice, stroking his beard. \u201cThat I know better! There are still blessed isles! Be silent about that, you sighing sadsack!</p><p>Stop splashing about that, you rain cloud of the morning! Do I not already stand here soaked by your gloom and drenched like a dog?</p><p>Now I\u2019ll shake myself and run away from you, so that I can dry off again; that shouldn\u2019t surprise you! Do I seem discourteous to you? But this is my court.</p><p>But as far as your higher man is concerned: let\u2019s go! I\u2019ll search for him right now in those woods \u2013 from there his cry came. Perhaps he is beset by some evil beast.</p><p>He is in my territory, and in here he shall not come to harm! And truly, there are many evil beasts in my territory.\u201d \u2013</p><p>With these words Zarathustra turned to leave. Then the soothsayer spoke: \u201cOh Zarathustra, you are a rogue!</p><p>I already know that you want to get rid of me! You would rather run into the woods and pursue evil beasts!</p><p>But what will it help you? By evening you will have me again anyway, I will be sitting in your own cave, patient and heavy like a block \u2013 and I will be waiting for you!\u201d</p><p>\u201cSo be it!\u201d called Zarathustra over his shoulder as he departed. \u201cAnd whatever is mine in my cave, it belongs to you too, my guest!</p><p>But if you should find honey in there, good! Then just lick it up, you old growling bear, and sweeten your soul! Because by evening we will both want to be in a good mood,</p><p>\u2013 in a good mood and glad that this day came to an end!

But as he sat there like this, with a stick in his hand and tracing the outline of his shadow on the ground, reflecting and, truly, not about himself and his shadow \u2013 then all at once he was frightened and startled, because next to his own shadow he saw another shadow. And as he quickly looked around and stood up, there was the soothsayer standing next to him, the same one whom he had wined and dined at his table, the proclaimer of the great weariness who taught: \u201cAll is the same, nothing is worth it, the world is without meaning, knowledge chokes.\u201d But his face had transformed in the meantime; and when Zarathustra looked him in the eyes, his heart was frightened again \u2013 so many grave proclamations and ashen gray lightning bolts animated this face.\r\n\r\nThe soothsayer, who read what was going on in Zarathustra\u2019s soul, wiped his hand over his face as if he wanted to wipe it away; Zarathustra did the same. And when both had silently composed and strengthened themselves in this manner, they shook hands as a sign that they wanted to recognize one another.\r\n\r\n\u201cWelcome,\u201d said Zarathustra, \u201cyou soothsayer of the great weariness; not for nothing were you once a guest at my table. Eat and drink with me today too, and forgive that a contented old man joins you at the table!\u201d \u201cA contented old man?\u201d answered the soothsayer, shaking his head. \u201cWhoever you are or want to be, oh Zarathustra, you\u2019ve been that long enough up here \u2013 in a short time your skiff will no longer be on the rocks!\u201d \u2013 \u201cAm I on the rocks then?\u201d asked Zarathustra, laughing. \u2013 \u201cThe waves around your mountain,\u201d answered the soothsayer, \u201crise and rise; the waves of great distress and gloom: soon they will lift your skiff as well and carry you away.\u201d \u2013 Zarathustra was silent on hearing this and surprised. \u2013 \u201cDo you not hear anything yet?\u201d continued the soothsayer. \u201cIs there not a rushing and roaring up from the depths?\u201d \u2013 Zarathustra kept silent and listened; then he heard a long, long cry that the abysses threw back and forth to each other, as if none wanted to keep it \u2013 so evil did it sound.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou wicked proclaimer,\u201d spoke Zarathustra at last. \u201cThat\u2019s a cry of distress and the cry of a human being, even if it comes out of a black sea. But what is human distress to me! My final sin, the one saved up for me \u2013 do you know what it\u2019s called?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cPity!\u201d answered the soothsayer from his overflowing heart, and he raised both hands high \u2013 \u201coh Zarathustra, I come to seduce you to your last sin!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nAnd scarcely had these words been spoken when the cry rang out again, and longer and more anxious than before, also much closer now. \u201cDo you hear? Do you hear, oh Zarathustra?\u201d cried the soothsayer. \u201cThe cry is meant for you, it calls you: come, come, come, it is time, it is high time!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nZarathustra was silent after this, confused and shaken; finally he asked, like one who hesitates inwardly: \u201cAnd who is it there that calls me?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut you know it already,\u201d answered the soothsayer vehemently. \u201cWhy do you conceal yourself? It is the higher man who calls for you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe higher man?\u201d cried Zarathustra, seized by horror. \u201cWhat does he want? What does he want? The higher man! What does he want here?\u201d \u2013 And his skin was bathed in sweat.\r\n\r\nBut the soothsayer did not respond to Zarathustra\u2019s fear, and instead he listened and listened toward the depths. But after it was quiet there for a long time, he turned his glance back and saw Zarathustra standing and trembling.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d he began with a sad voice. \u201cYou do not stand there like one whose happiness makes him giddy: you will have to dance to keep from falling down!\r\n\r\nBut even if you were to dance before me and leap all your side-leaps, no one should be allowed to tell me: \u2018Look, here dances the last gay human being!\u2019\r\n\r\nAnyone who came to this height looking for him would come in vain; caves he would find, to be sure, and hinter-caves, hiding places for hiders, but no shafts of happiness and treasure chambers and new golden veins of happiness.\r\n\r\nHappiness \u2013 how could anyone find happiness among those who are buried away and hermits? Must I seek the last happiness far away on blessed isles between forgotten seas?\r\n\r\nBut all is the same, nothing is worth it, searching does not help, and there are no blessed isles anymore!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus sighed the soothsayer; but at his last sigh Zarathustra became bright and certain once more, like someone who comes from a deep chasm into the light. \u201cNo! No! No! Three times no!\u201d he cried in a strong voice, stroking his beard. \u201cThat I know better! There are still blessed isles! Be silent about that, you sighing sadsack!\r\n\r\nStop splashing about that, you rain cloud of the morning! Do I not already stand here soaked by your gloom and drenched like a dog?\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019ll shake myself and run away from you, so that I can dry off again; that shouldn\u2019t surprise you! Do I seem discourteous to you? But this is my court.\r\n\r\nBut as far as your higher man is concerned: let\u2019s go! I\u2019ll search for him right now in those woods \u2013 from there his cry came. Perhaps he is beset by some evil beast.\r\n\r\nHe is in my territory, and in here he shall not come to harm! And truly, there are many evil beasts in my territory.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nWith these words Zarathustra turned to leave. Then the soothsayer spoke: \u201cOh Zarathustra, you are a rogue!\r\n\r\nI already know that you want to get rid of me! You would rather run into the woods and pursue evil beasts!\r\n\r\nBut what will it help you? By evening you will have me again anyway, I will be sitting in your own cave, patient and heavy like a block \u2013 and I will be waiting for you!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo be it!\u201d called Zarathustra over his shoulder as he departed. \u201cAnd whatever is mine in my cave, it belongs to you too, my guest!\r\n\r\nBut if you should find honey in there, good! Then just lick it up, you old growling bear, and sweeten your soul! Because by evening we will both want to be in a good mood,\r\n\r\n\u2013 in a good mood and glad that this day came to an end! And you yourself will dance to my songs as my dancing bear.\r\n\r\nYou don\u2019t believe it? You shake your head? Well then! We\u2019ll see, old bear! But I too am \u2013 a soothsayer.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 80}, {"data": {"uuid": "5709b7a3-5e22-4c31-953f-2dd39bac3be1", "user": 1, "title": "Conversation with the Kings", "created_on": "2023-05-10 16:50:27.248941+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 16:50:27.268744+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>Conversation with the Kings</h2><h3>1</h3><p>Zarathustra had been underway in his mountains and woods for not even one hour when all at once he saw a strange procession. On precisely the path he wanted to take down, two kings came walking, adorned with crowns and purple sashes and as colorful as flamingoes; before them they drove a burdened ass. \u201cWhat do these kings want in my kingdom?\u201d spoke Zarathustra to his astonished heart, and he hid himself quickly behind a bush. But when the kings caught up to him he said, half out loud like a person talking to himself: \u201cStrange! Strange! What rhyme or reason can this have? I see two kings \u2013 and only one ass!\u201d</p><p>Then the two kings stopped, smiled, looked toward the place from which the voice had come and then turned to face one another. \u201cSuch things are also thought among us,\u201d said the king to the right, \u201cbut one does not speak it.\u201d</p><p>But the king to the left shrugged his shoulders and answered: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a goatherd. Or a hermit who has lived too long among cliffs and trees. After all, no society at all also ruins good manners.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGood manners?\u201d retorted the other king indignantly and bitterly. \u201cThen what are we trying to run away from? Is it not \u2018good manners\u2019? Is it not our \u2018good society?\u2019</p><p>Better, truly, to live among hermits and goatherds than live with our gilded, fake, make-up wearing rabble \u2013 even if it calls itself \u2018good society,\u2019</p><p>\u2013 even if it calls itself \u2018nobility.\u2019 But there everything is fake and foul, starting with the blood, thanks to old diseases and even worse healers.</p><p>Best and dearest to me today is still a healthy peasant, coarse, cunning, stubborn, enduring: that is the most noble type today.</p><p>The peasant today is the best; and peasant-type should be ruler! But it is the kingdom of the rabble \u2013 I will not be deceived anymore. Rabble now, that means: mishmash.</p><p>Rabble mishmash: in it everything is jumbled together, saint and scoundrel and Junker and Jew and every beast from the ark of Noah.</p><p>Good manners! Everything among us is fake and foul. No one knows how to revere anymore \u2013 that precisely is what we are running away from. They are mawkish, obtrusive dogs, they are gilders of palm leaves.</p><p>This nausea chokes me, that we kings ourselves became fake, decked out and dressed up in old yellowed grandfathers\u2019 pomp, medals for the most moronic and the slyest and whoever the hell haggles today for power!</p><p>We are not the first \u2013 and yet we must signify that we are: it is this deception that we have finally had enough of, that nauseates us.</p><p>We got away from the riffraff, all these screamers and scribble-blowflies, all the shopkeeper stench, all the twitching ambition, all the bad breath \u2013 phooey to living among the riffraff,</p><p>\u2013 phooey to signifying the first among the riffraff! Oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea! What do we kings matter anymore!\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u201cYour old illness befalls you again,\u201d said now the king on the left. \u201cNausea befalls you, my poor brother. But you know too that someone is listening to us.\u201d</p><p>At once Zarathustra, whose ears and eyes had opened wide at this conversation, rose from his hiding place, approached the kings and began:</p><p>\u201cThe one who listens to you, who listens gladly to you, you kings, is called Zarathustra.</p><p>I am Zarathustra, who once spoke: \u2018What do kings matter anymore!\u2019 Forgive me, I was so pleased when you said to one another: \u2018What do we kings matter!\u2019</p><p>But here is my realm and my rule: what might you be seeking now in my realm? Or perhaps you have found along the way what I am seeking, namely the higher man.\u201d</p><p>When the kings heard this they beat their breasts and exclaimed with one voice: \u201cWe have been found out!</p><p>With the sword of your words you strike through our hearts\u2019 thickest darkness. You discover our distress, for behold! We are on our way to find the higher man \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the man who is higher than we, even though we are kings. To him we lead this ass. The highest man, you see, should be the highest ruler on earth.</p><p>There is no harder misfortune in all human destiny than when the powerful of the earth are not also the first human beings. Then everything becomes fake and crooked and monstrous.</p><p>And should they even be last and more beast than human; then the rabble rises and rises in price, until finally even rabble virtue speaks: \u2018Behold, I alone am virtue!\u2019\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u201cWhat did I just hear?\u201d answered Zarathustra. \u201cWhat wisdom among kings! I am delighted, and truly, I\u2019m already in the mood to make a rhyme of it: \u2013</p><p>\u2013 even if it turns out to be a rhyme that is not suitable for everyone\u2019s ears. Long ago I gave up being considerate of long ears. Well then! Well now!</p><p>(But here it happened that the ass too got in a word; and clearly and malevolently he said hee-yaw.)</p><p>Once \u2013 I think in anno domini one \u2013</p><p>The Sybil said, drunk, though wine she\u2019d had none:</p><p>\u2018Oh no, how badly things go!</p><p>Decline! Decline! The world has sunk so low!</p><p>Rome sank to whore and to a whorehouse too,</p><p>Rome\u2019s Caesar to beast, God himself \u2013 turned Jew!\u2019\u201d</p><h3>2</h3><p>The kings were enchanted by these rhymes of Zarathustra, but the king to the right spoke: \u201cOh Zarathustra, how well we did in going forth to see you!</p><p>For your enemies showed us your image in their mirror: there you were with your devil\u2019s grimace and laughing scornfully, such that we were afraid of you.</p><p>But what good did it do? Again and again you pricked our ears and hearts with your sayings, then we said at last: what does it matter how he looks!</p><p>We have to hear him, the one who teaches \u2018you shall love peace as a means to new wars, and the short peace more than the long one!\u2019</p><p>No one has ever spoken such warlike words: \u2018What is good? Being brave is good. The good war hallows any cause.\u2019</p><p>Oh Zarathustra, our fathers\u2019 blood stirred in our bodies at the sound of such words; it was like the speech of springtime to old casks of wine.</p><p>When swords ran every which way like red-stained snakes, our fathers warmed to life; the sun of all peace seemed limp and lackluster to them, but the long peace caused them shame.</p><p>How they sighed, our fathers, when they saw gleaming bright, dried up swords on the wall! Like them, they thirsted for war. For a sword wants to drink blood and sparkles with desire.\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u2013 As the kings talked in this manner and gabbed enthusiastically about the happiness of their fathers, Zarathustra was overcome by no small desire to mock their enthusiasm; after all, these were visibly very peaceful kings he saw standing before him, the kind with old and refined faces. But he restrained himself. \u201cWell then!\u201d he said. \u201cThe path leads there, Zarathustra\u2019s cave lies there, and this day shall also have a long evening! But now a cry of distress hurries me away from you.</p><p>It will honor my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it, but, to be sure, you will have to wait long!</p><p>Alright! What\u2019s the harm? Where does one learn to wait better today than at court?

On precisely the path he wanted to take down, two kings came walking, adorned with crowns and purple sashes and as colorful as flamingoes; before them they drove a burdened ass. \u201cWhat do these kings want in my kingdom?\u201d spoke Zarathustra to his astonished heart, and he hid himself quickly behind a bush. But when the kings caught up to him he said, half out loud like a person talking to himself: \u201cStrange! Strange! What rhyme or reason can this have? I see two kings \u2013 and only one ass!\u201d\r\n\r\nThen the two kings stopped, smiled, looked toward the place from which the voice had come and then turned to face one another. \u201cSuch things are also thought among us,\u201d said the king to the right, \u201cbut one does not speak it.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut the king to the left shrugged his shoulders and answered: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a goatherd. Or a hermit who has lived too long among cliffs and trees. After all, no society at all also ruins good manners.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood manners?\u201d retorted the other king indignantly and bitterly. \u201cThen what are we trying to run away from? Is it not \u2018good manners\u2019? Is it not our \u2018good society?\u2019\r\n\r\nBetter, truly, to live among hermits and goatherds than live with our gilded, fake, make-up wearing rabble \u2013 even if it calls itself \u2018good society,\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2013 even if it calls itself \u2018nobility.\u2019 But there everything is fake and foul, starting with the blood, thanks to old diseases and even worse healers.\r\n\r\nBest and dearest to me today is still a healthy peasant, coarse, cunning, stubborn, enduring: that is the most noble type today.\r\n\r\nThe peasant today is the best; and peasant-type should be ruler! But it is the kingdom of the rabble \u2013 I will not be deceived anymore. Rabble now, that means: mishmash.\r\n\r\nRabble mishmash: in it everything is jumbled together, saint and scoundrel and Junker and Jew and every beast from the ark of Noah.\r\n\r\nGood manners! Everything among us is fake and foul. No one knows how to revere anymore \u2013 that precisely is what we are running away from. They are mawkish, obtrusive dogs, they are gilders of palm leaves.\r\n\r\nThis nausea chokes me, that we kings ourselves became fake, decked out and dressed up in old yellowed grandfathers\u2019 pomp, medals for the most moronic and the slyest and whoever the hell haggles today for power!\r\n\r\nWe are not the first \u2013 and yet we must signify that we are: it is this deception that we have finally had enough of, that nauseates us.\r\n\r\nWe got away from the riffraff, all these screamers and scribble-blowflies, all the shopkeeper stench, all the twitching ambition, all the bad breath \u2013 phooey to living among the riffraff,\r\n\r\n\u2013 phooey to signifying the first among the riffraff! Oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea! What do we kings matter anymore!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cYour old illness befalls you again,\u201d said now the king on the left. \u201cNausea befalls you, my poor brother. But you know too that someone is listening to us.\u201d\r\n\r\nAt once Zarathustra, whose ears and eyes had opened wide at this conversation, rose from his hiding place, approached the kings and began:\r\n\r\n\u201cThe one who listens to you, who listens gladly to you, you kings, is called Zarathustra.\r\n\r\nI am Zarathustra, who once spoke: \u2018What do kings matter anymore!\u2019 Forgive me, I was so pleased when you said to one another: \u2018What do we kings matter!\u2019\r\n\r\nBut here is my realm and my rule: what might you be seeking now in my realm? Or perhaps you have found along the way what I am seeking, namely the higher man.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhen the kings heard this they beat their breasts and exclaimed with one voice: \u201cWe have been found out!\r\n\r\nWith the sword of your words you strike through our hearts\u2019 thickest darkness. You discover our distress, for behold! We are on our way to find the higher man \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 the man who is higher than we, even though we are kings. To him we lead this ass. The highest man, you see, should be the highest ruler on earth.\r\n\r\nThere is no harder misfortune in all human destiny than when the powerful of the earth are not also the first human beings. Then everything becomes fake and crooked and monstrous.\r\n\r\nAnd should they even be last and more beast than human; then the rabble rises and rises in price, until finally even rabble virtue speaks: \u2018Behold, I alone am virtue!\u2019\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat did I just hear?\u201d answered Zarathustra. \u201cWhat wisdom among kings! I am delighted, and truly, I\u2019m already in the mood to make a rhyme of it: \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 even if it turns out to be a rhyme that is not suitable for everyone\u2019s ears. Long ago I gave up being considerate of long ears. Well then! Well now!\r\n\r\n(But here it happened that the ass too got in a word; and clearly and malevolently he said hee-yaw.)\r\n\r\nOnce \u2013 I think in anno domini one \u2013\r\n\r\nThe Sybil said, drunk, though wine she\u2019d had none:\r\n\r\n\u2018Oh no, how badly things go!\r\n\r\nDecline! Decline! The world has sunk so low!\r\n\r\nRome sank to whore and to a whorehouse too,\r\n\r\nRome\u2019s Caesar to beast, God himself \u2013 turned Jew!\u2019\u201d\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nThe kings were enchanted by these rhymes of Zarathustra, but the king to the right spoke: \u201cOh Zarathustra, how well we did in going forth to see you!\r\n\r\nFor your enemies showed us your image in their mirror: there you were with your devil\u2019s grimace and laughing scornfully, such that we were afraid of you.\r\n\r\nBut what good did it do? Again and again you pricked our ears and hearts with your sayings, then we said at last: what does it matter how he looks!\r\n\r\nWe have to hear him, the one who teaches \u2018you shall love peace as a means to new wars, and the short peace more than the long one!\u2019\r\n\r\nNo one has ever spoken such warlike words: \u2018What is good? Being brave is good. The good war hallows any cause.\u2019\r\n\r\nOh Zarathustra, our fathers\u2019 blood stirred in our bodies at the sound of such words; it was like the speech of springtime to old casks of wine.\r\n\r\nWhen swords ran every which way like red-stained snakes, our fathers warmed to life; the sun of all peace seemed limp and lackluster to them, but the long peace caused them shame.\r\n\r\nHow they sighed, our fathers, when they saw gleaming bright, dried up swords on the wall! Like them, they thirsted for war. For a sword wants to drink blood and sparkles with desire.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 As the kings talked in this manner and gabbed enthusiastically about the happiness of their fathers, Zarathustra was overcome by no small desire to mock their enthusiasm; after all, these were visibly very peaceful kings he saw standing before him, the kind with old and refined faces. But he restrained himself. \u201cWell then!\u201d he said. \u201cThe path leads there, Zarathustra\u2019s cave lies there, and this day shall also have a long evening! But now a cry of distress hurries me away from you.\r\n\r\nIt will honor my cave if kings want to sit and wait in it, but, to be sure, you will have to wait long!\r\n\r\nAlright! What\u2019s the harm? Where does one learn to wait better today than at court? And the whole virtue of kings that is left to them \u2013 is it not today called: being able to wait?\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 81}, {"data": {"uuid": "8e15bb43-3ecb-4c83-aff7-e4197b3cfbf0", "user": 1, "title": "The Leech", "created_on": "2023-05-10 16:51:18.771273+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 16:51:18.790506+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Leech</h2><p>And Zarathustra walked on pensively, farther and deeper through woods and past swampy valleys; but as happens to anyone who reflects on grave matters, he unintentionally stepped on someone.

Are they not after all both \u2013 lonely!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cWhoever you may be,\u201d said the stepped on man, still grimly, \u201cyou step on my dignity with your parable too, and not only with your foot!\r\n\r\nSee here, am I some kind of dog?\u201d \u2013 and then the sitting man got up and pulled his bare arm out of the swamp. Because at first he had lain stretched out on the ground, hidden and unrecognizable like those who lie in wait for swamp quarry.\r\n\r\n\u201cBut what in blazes are you doing!\u201d cried Zarathustra, shocked. For he saw that much blood was flowing over the man\u2019s bare arm. \u201cYou wretch, did some wicked beast bite you?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe bleeding man laughed, but still angrily. \u201cWhat concern is it of yours!\u201d he said, and made to leave. \u201cHere I am at home and in my territory. Anyone who wants may question me, but I will hardly answer a stumbling fool.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d said Zarathustra, with pity, and he held on to him. \u201cYou are mistaken: here you are not in your home, but in my realm, and in here no one comes to harm.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile call me whatever you want \u2013 I am who I must be. I call myself Zarathustra.\r\n\r\nWell then! Up there is the path to Zarathustra\u2019s cave; it isn\u2019t far \u2013 wouldn\u2019t you like to care for your wounds at my place?\r\n\r\nThings have gone badly for you in this life, you wretch; first you were bitten by the beasts, and then \u2013 you were stepped on by a human being!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nBut when the stepped on man heard the name of Zarathustra, he transformed. \u201cWhat is happening to me!\u201d he cried out. \u201cWho concerns me anymore in this life other than this one person, namely Zarathustra, and that one animal that lives off blood, the leech?\r\n\r\nFor the leech\u2019s sake I lay here at this swamp like a fisher, and already my outstretched arm had been bitten ten times, then an even more beautiful leech bites on my blood, Zarathustra himself!\r\n\r\nOh happiness! Oh miracle! Praised be the day that lured me to this swamp! Praised be the best, liveliest cupping glass living today, praised be the great conscience-leech Zarathustra!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke the stepped on man; and Zarathustra was pleased at his words and their fine, respectful manner. \u201cWho are you?\u201d he said, and offered him his hand. \u201cBetween us there is much to clear up and to cheer up; but already it seems to me the day is growing pure and bright.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI am the conscientious of spirit,\u201d answered the man, \u201cand in matters of the spirit one can hardly be more rigorous, vigorous and venomous than I, except the one from whom I learned it, Zarathustra himself.\r\n\r\nRather know nothing, than know much half way! Rather be a fool in one\u2019s own right than a wise man according to strangers. I \u2013 go to the ground of things:\r\n\r\n\u2013 what does it matter whether it is big or small? Whether it is called swamp or sky? A hand\u2019s breadth of ground is enough for me, if only it is real ground and bottom!\r\n\r\n\u2013 a hand\u2019s breadth of ground: on that one can stand. In proper science and conscience there is nothing great and nothing small.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo perhaps you are the expert on the leech?\u201d asked Zarathustra. \u201cAnd you pursue the leech down to its ultimate grounds, you conscientious one?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d answered the stepped on man. \u201cThat would be a monstrous undertaking, how could I presume to such a thing!\r\n\r\nWhat I am master and expert of, however, is the leech\u2019s brain \u2013 that is my world!\r\n\r\nAnd it is a world too! But forgive me that my pride speaks up here, for in this matter I have no equal. That is why I said \u2018here I am at home.\u2019\r\n\r\nHow long already have I pursued this one thing, the brain of the leech, so that the slippery truth no longer slips away from me here? Here is my realm!\r\n\r\n\u2013 this is why I threw away everything else, this is why all else is the same to me; and right next to my knowledge my black ignorance lurks.\r\n\r\nMy conscience of spirit wants of me that I know one thing and do not know everything else; I am nauseated by all halfness of spirit, all hazy, soaring, rapturous people.\r\n\r\nWhere my honesty ceases I am blind and also want to be blind. But where I want to know, I also want to be honest, namely venomous, rigorous, vigorous, cruel and inexorable.\r\n\r\nThat you once said, oh Zarathustra: \u2018Spirit is the life that itself cuts into life,\u2019 that induced and seduced me to your teaching. And truly, with my own blood I increased my own knowledge!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cAnd it shows too,\u201d interrupted Zarathustra; for blood was still flowing from the bare arm of the conscientious one. No fewer than ten leeches, after all, had bored themselves into it.\r\n\r\n\u201cOh you weird fellow, how much is revealed to me by your appearance, namely you yourself! And maybe I should not pour all of it into your rigorous ears!\r\n\r\nWell then! Let\u2019s part here! But I would like to find you again. Up there leads the path to my cave; tonight you shall be my dear guest there!\r\n\r\nI would also like to make it up to your body that Zarathustra stepped on you with his feet; I\u2019ll be thinking about that. But now a cry of distress hurries me away from you.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra."}, "id": 82}, {"data": {"uuid": "f6be4397-471c-4d28-9b7f-12d6ec710b0c", "user": 1, "title": "The Magician", "created_on": "2023-05-10 16:52:21.551158+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 16:52:21.575843+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Magician</h2><h3>1</h3><p>But as Zarathustra made his way around a boulder he saw someone not far below him on the same path, flailing his limbs like a raving madman, who finally flopped belly-first to the ground. \u201cStop!\u201d said Zarathustra to his heart. \u201cThat one there must be the higher man, that awful cry of distress came from him \u2013 I\u2019ll go see if I can help.\u201d But when he ran to the spot where the person lay on the ground, he found a trembling old man with a fixed gaze; and as hard as Zarathustra tried to prop him up and stand him on his feet again, it was in vain.

You counterfeiter! You liar from top to bottom! I recognize you well!</p><p>I\u2019ll give you warm legs, you wicked magician, I\u2019m very good at heating up people like you!\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cDesist,\u201d said the old man and he leaped to his feet. \u201cBeat me no more, oh Zarathustra!

And verily, you saw through me well!</p><p>But you yourself \u2013 you also tested me with no small sample of yourself: you are hard, you wise Zarathustra! You hit hard with your \u2018truths,\u2019 your cudgel forces this truth out of me!\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cDo not flatter,\u201d answered Zarathustra, still upset and frowning darkly, \u201cyou actor from top to bottom! You\u2019re fake \u2013 why do you talk \u2013 of truth!</p><p>You peacock of peacocks, you sea of vanity, what are you playing before me, you wicked magician, in whom am I supposed to believe when you wail in this form?\u201d</p><p>\u201cThe penitent of the spirit,\u201d said the old man. \u201cHim I played: you yourself once coined this phrase \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the poet and magician who ultimately turns his spirit against himself, the transformed one who freezes to death from his own evil science and conscience.</p><p>And just admit it: it took you a long time, oh Zarathustra, before you saw through my art and lie! You believed in my distress when you cradled my head with both hands \u2013</p><p>\u2013 I heard you wail \u2018they loved him too little, loved him too little!\u2019 That I was able to deceive you to such an extent, that causes my malice to jubilate secretly.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou may have deceived finer heads than me,\u201d said Zarathustra harshly. \u201cI am not on my guard for deceivers, I have to be without caution \u2013 my fate wants it so.</p><p>But you \u2013 have to deceive: that much I know about you! You always have to be e-quivocal, tri-, quad- and quinquivocal! Even what you just now confessed was not nearly true nor false enough for me!</p><p>You wicked counterfeiter, how could you do otherwise! You would even put make-up on your disease when you show yourself naked to your physician.</p><p>Just like you put make-up on your lie before me when you said \u2018I only did this as a game!\u2019 There was earnest in it, you are something of a penitent of the spirit!</p><p>I guessed you well: you became everyone\u2019s enchanter, but against yourself you have no lie and no guile left over \u2013 you are disenchanted of yourself!</p><p>You harvested nausea as your single truth. Not a word of yours is genuine anymore, except your mouth: namely the nausea that clings to your mouth.\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u2013 \u201cWho are you!\u201d yelled the old magician at this point, with defiance in his voice. \u201cWho is permitted to speak with me thus, the greatest person living today?\u201d \u2013 and an emerald bolt of lightning shot from his eye toward Zarathustra. But then he transformed immediately and said sadly:</p><p>\u201cOh Zarathustra, I am weary of and nauseated by my arts, I am not great, why do I pretend! But, you know it well \u2013 I sought greatness!</p><p>I wanted to represent a great human being and I persuaded many; but this lie was beyond my powers. On it I break down.</p><p>Oh Zarathustra, everything about me is a lie; but that I am breaking down \u2013 this breaking down is genuine!\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u201cIt does you honor,\u201d spoke Zarathustra somberly and glancing down to the side, \u201cit does you honor that you sought greatness, but it also betrays you. You are not great.</p><p>You wicked old magician, that is your best and most honest, and what I honor in you, namely that you wearied of yourself and said so: \u2018I am not great.\u2019</p><p>In that I honor you as a penitent of the spirit; and even if it was only for a whiff and a wink, for this one moment you were \u2013 genuine.</p><p>But tell me, what do you seek here in my woods and cliffs? And when you laid yourself in my path, what did you want to test in me? \u2013</p><p>\u2013 why did you research me?\u201d \u2013</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra, and his eyes flashed. The old magician was silent for a while, then he said: \u201cDid I research you? I merely \u2013 search.</p><p>Oh Zarathustra, I seek someone who is genuine, proper, simple, unequivocal, a human being of all honesty, a vessel of wisdom, a saint of knowledge, a great human being!</p><p>Do you not know it, oh Zarathustra? I seek Zarathustra.\u201d</p><p>\u2013 And here a long silence ensued between the two; but Zarathustra became deeply immersed in himself, such that he closed his eyes. But then, turning back to his interlocutor, he seized the hand of the magician and spoke, full of kindness and craftiness:</p><p>\u201cWell then! Up there leads the path, there lies the cave of Zarathustra. In it you may seek whomever you wish to find.</p><p>And ask my animals for advice, my eagle and my snake: they shall help you seek. But my cave is big.</p><p>For my part \u2013 I\u2019ve never seen a great human being. The eyes of the finest are too coarse today for what is great. It is the kingdom of the rabble.</p><p>Many a one I found already, who stretched and puffed himself up, and the people cried: \u2018See here, a great human being!\u2019 But what good are all bellows! In the end only wind comes out.</p><p>In the end a frog will burst if it puffs itself up too long: then only wind comes out. To stab a swollen person in the belly \u2013 that\u2019s what I call great fun. Hear me, you little boys!</p><p>Today belongs to the rabble; who knows anymore what is great, what is small! Who could successfully search for greatness! Only a fool \u2013 fools would succeed.</p><p>You seek great human beings, you queer fool? Who taught you that? Is the time for that today? Oh you wicked searcher \u2013 why do you research me?\u201d \u2013</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra, comforted in his heart, and off he went again on his way, laughing.</p>", "article_json": {"type": "doc", "content": [{"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 2}, "content": [{"text": "The Magician", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 3}, "content": [{"text": "1", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"text": "But as Zarathustra made his way around a boulder he saw someone not far below him on the same path, flailing his limbs like a raving madman, who finally flopped belly-first to the ground. \u201cStop!\u201d said Zarathustra to his heart. \u201cThat one there must be the higher man, that awful cry of distress came from him \u2013 I\u2019ll go see if I can help.\u201d But when he ran to the spot where the person lay on the ground, he found a trembling old man with a fixed gaze; and as hard as Zarathustra tried to prop him up and stand him on his feet again, it was in vain.

And for this reason the shepherds called this valley: Snake Death.</p><p>Now Zarathustra sank into a black reminiscence, for it seemed to him that he had already stood in this valley once before. And much graveness spread itself over his mind, such that he walked slowly and ever more slowly until finally he stood still. But then, when he opened his eyes he saw something sitting beside the path, shaped like a human but scarcely like a human, something unspeakable. And all of a sudden Zarathustra was overcome with great shame for having looked upon such a thing with his own eyes; blushing all the way up to his white hair, he averted his gaze and picked up his foot, intending to leave this wicked spot. But then a noise animated the dead wasteland; it welled up from the ground gurgling and rattling, like water gurgles and rattles at night through clogged water pipes, until finally it turned into a human voice and human speech \u2013 that sounded like this.</p><p>\u201cZarathustra! Zarathustra! Guess my riddle! Speak, speak! What is revenge against the witness?</p><p>I lure you back, there is slippery ice here! See to it, see to it that your pride does not break its legs here!</p><p>You consider yourself wise, you proud Zarathustra! Then go ahead and guess the riddle, you hard nut cracker \u2013 the riddle that I am! So tell me: who am I?\u201d</p><p>\u2013 But when Zarathustra had heard these words \u2013 what do you think took place in his soul? He was overwhelmed with pity; and he collapsed at once like an oak tree that has long withstood many wood cutters \u2013 heavily, suddenly, to the terror of even those who wanted to fell it. But right away he picked himself up from the ground and his face had become hard.</p><p>\u201cI recognize you alright,\u201d he spoke with a voice of bronze: \u201cYou are the murderer of God! Let me go.</p><p>You could not bear the one who saw you \u2013 who saw you always and through and through, you ugliest human being! You took revenge on this witness!\u201d</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra and wanted to leave; but the unspeakable one latched on to a corner of his garment and began again to gurgle and to search for words. \u201cStay!\u201d he said at last \u2013</p><p>\u2013 \u201cStay! Do not pass by! I guessed what kind of axe knocked you to the ground: Hail to you, oh Zarathustra, that you stand again!</p><p>You guessed, I know it well, how he who killed him feels \u2013 the murderer of God. Stay! Sit down here with me, it will not be in vain.</p><p>To whom did I want to go, if not to you? Stay, sit down! But do not look at me! Honor thus \u2013 my ugliness!</p><p>They persecute me; now you are my last refuge. Not with their hatred, not with their bailiffs \u2013 oh such persecution I would mock and be proud and glad!</p><p>Has not everything successful hitherto been done by the well-persecuted? And whoever persecutes well easily learns to succeed \u2013 after all he is already \u2013 after somebody! But it\u2019s their pity \u2013</p><p>\u2013 their pity is what I flee and why I flee to you. Oh Zarathustra, protect me, you my last refuge, you the only one to guess me:</p><p>\u2013 you guessed how he who killed him feels. Stay! And if you want to go, you impatient one: do not go the way that I came. That way is bad.</p><p>Are you angry with me that I\u2019ve already spoken broken words for too long? That I even counsel you? But know this, it\u2019s me, the ugliest human being,</p><p>\u2013 who also has the biggest, heaviest feet. Where I walked, the way is bad. I trample all ways to death and to ruin.</p><p>But that you passed me by, silently; that you blushed, I saw it well: that\u2019s how I recognized you as Zarathustra.</p><p>Any other would have tossed me his alms, his pity, with looks and speech. But for that \u2013 I am not beggar enough, you guessed that \u2013</p><p>\u2013for that I am too rich, rich in what is great, what is terrible, what is ugliest, what is most unspeakable! Your shame, oh Zarathustra, honored me!</p><p>With difficulty I managed to escape the throng of the pitying \u2013 to find the only one today who teaches \u2018pitying is obtrusive\u2019 \u2013 you, oh Zarathustra!</p><p>\u2013 Be it a god\u2019s, be it the pity of mankind: pitying is offensive to shame. And not wanting to help can be more noble than the virtue that leaps to help.</p><p>But today that is what passes for virtue itself among all small people, pity \u2013 they have no respect for great misfortune, for great ugliness, for great failure.</p><p>I look away over all these people like a dog looks away over the backs of teeming flocks of sheep. They are small, good-wooled and good-willed gray people.</p><p>Like a heron looks away contemptuously over shallow ponds, its head tossed back; thus I look away over teeming gray little waves and wills and souls.</p><p>They have been deemed to be right for too long, these small people; and so in the end they were given might too \u2013 now they teach: \u2018the only good is what small people call good.\u2019</p><p>And \u2018truth\u2019 today is what the preacher spoke, the one who himself came from among them, that odd holy man and advocate of small people who testified of himself: \u2018I \u2013 am the truth.\u2019</p><p>This immodest person has for a long time now caused small people to get big heads \u2013 he who taught no small error when he taught \u2018I \u2013 am the truth.\u2019</p><p>Was an immodest person ever answered more courteously? \u2013 But you, oh Zarathustra, passed him by and said: \u2018No! No! Three times no!\u2019</p><p>You warned against his error, you were the first to warn against pity \u2013 not all, not none, but yourself and your kind.</p><p>You are ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and indeed, when you say \u2018from pitying a great cloud is coming, beware, you human beings!\u2019</p><p>\u2013 when you teach \u2018all creators are hard, all great love is above pitying\u2019: oh Zarathustra, how well schooled you seem to me in predicting the weather!</p><p>But you yourself \u2013 warn yourself too against your pitying! Because many are on their way to you, many who are suffering, doubting, despairing, drowning, freezing \u2013</p><p>I warn you against me too. You guessed my best and worst riddle, me myself and what I did. I know the axe that fells you.</p><p>But he \u2013 had to die: he saw with eyes that saw everything \u2013 he saw the depths and grounds of human beings, all their hidden disgrace and ugliness.</p><p>His pitying knew no shame: he crawled into my filthiest nook. This most curious, super-obtrusive, super-pitying one had to die.</p><p>He always saw me: I wanted revenge on such a witness \u2013 or to no longer live myself.</p><p>The god who saw everything, even human beings: this god had to die! Human beings cannot bear that such a witness lives.\u201d</p><p>Thus spoke the ugliest human being. But Zarathustra rose and set about to leave, because he was chilled down to his entrails.</p><p>\u201cYou unspeakable one,\u201d he said, \u201cyou warned me against your way. Out of gratitude I now commend mine to you. Look, up there lies Zarathustra\u2019s cave.</p><p>My cave is big and deep and has many nooks; there the most hidden person will find a hiding place. And close by are a hundred burrows and tunnels for crawling, flapping and leaping wildlife.</p><p>You outcast, who cast himself out, you no longer want to dwell among human beings and human pity? Well then, do as I do! Thus you\u2019ll also learn from me; only the doer learns.</p><p>And speak first and foremost with my animals! The proudest animal and the wisest animal \u2013 they are surely the right counselors for both of us!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra and continued on his way, pensive and even more slowly than before; because he had much to ask himself and knew no easy way to answer.</p><p>\u201cHow poor indeed is a human being!\u201d he thought in his heart, \u201chow ugly, how gasping, how full of concealed shame!</p><p>They tell me that human beings love themselves; oh, how great this self-love must be! How much contempt it has against it!</p><p>Even this man here loved himself, as he despised himself \u2013 to me he seems a great lover and a great despiser.</p><p>I\u2019ve never found anyone who despised himself more deeply; that too is elevation. Oh no, was he perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?</p><p>I love the great despisers. Human being, however, is something that must be overcome.\u201d \u2013</p><p>The Voluntary Beggar</p><p>When Zarathustra had left the ugliest human being, he was freezing and he felt lonely; after all, so much that was cold and lonely went through his mind, to the point where even his limbs grew colder because of it. But as he climbed further and further, up, down, now past green meadows, but then also across wild stony deposits where previously an impatient brook might have laid itself to bed, then all at once his mood became warmer and more cordial.</p><p>\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d he asked himself, \u201csomething warm and lively refreshes me, something that must be close to me.</p><p>Already I am less alone; unknown companions and brothers roam around me, their warm breath touches on my soul.\u201d</p><p>But when he peered about himself and searched for the comforters of his solitude, oddly enough, it was cows huddled together on a knoll; their nearness and smell had warmed his heart. Now these cows seemed engrossed in listening to someone speaking, and they paid no attention to the one who approached them. But when Zarathustra was quite near them he heard clearly how a human voice spoke from the midst of the cows; and evidently they had all turned their heads toward the speaker.</p><p>Then Zarathustra leaped up eagerly and pushed the animals apart, fearing that someone might have come to harm here, which could scarcely be remedied by the pity of cows. But in this he had deceived himself; for indeed, there sat someone on the ground and appeared to be persuading the animals to not be afraid of him, a peaceful man and mountain preacher from whose eyes goodness itself preached. \u201cWhat are you seeking here?\u201d cried Zarathustra, astonished.</p><p>\u201cWhat am I seeking here?\u201d he answered: \u201cThe same thing you seek, you trouble maker! Namely happiness on earth.</p><p>But for that I want to learn from these cows. And you should know, I\u2019ve already persuaded them half the morning, and just now they wanted to tell me for sure. Why do you have to disturb them?</p><p>Unless we are converted and become as cows, we will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. For there is one thing that we ought to learn from them: chewing the cud.</p><p>And truly, what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and did not learn this one thing, chewing the cud: what would it help? He would not be rid of his misery</p><p>\u2013 his great misery: which today is called nausea. Who today does not have heart, mouth and eyes full of nausea? You too! You too! But just look at these cows here!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Thus spoke the mountain preacher and then he turned his own gaze on Zarathustra \u2013 for till now his gaze hung lovingly on the cows \u2013 then, however, it transformed. \u201cWho is this with whom I speak?\u201d he cried, startled, and jumped up from the ground.</p><p>\u201cThis is the man without nausea, this is Zarathustra himself, the one who overcame great nausea, this is the eye, this is the mouth, this is the heart of Zarathustra himself.\u201d</p><p>And while he spoke thus he kissed the hands of the one to whom he spoke, and tears streamed from his eyes, and he behaved quite like someone to whom a precious gift and treasure falls unexpectedly from heaven. The cows, meanwhile, watched all of this and were amazed.</p><p>\u201cDo not speak of me, you odd, you lovely man!\u201d said Zarathustra and he restrained his tenderness. \u201cTell me first about yourself ! Are you not the voluntary beggar who once threw away great wealth \u2013</p><p>\u2013 who once was ashamed of his wealth and of the wealthy, and fled to the poorest people, to give them his fullness and his heart? But they did not accept him.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut they did not accept me,\u201d said the voluntary beggar, \u201cyou know it already. So in the end I went to the animals and to these cows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cThen you learned,\u201d Zarathustra interrupted the speaker, \u201chow it is harder to grant right than to take right, and that bestowing well is an art and the ultimate, craftiest master-art of kindness.\u201d</p><p>\u201cEspecially nowadays,\u201d answered the voluntary beggar. \u201cNowadays, namely, where everything lowly has become rebellious and skittish and haughty in its own way: namely in a rabble way.</p><p>For the hour has come, you know it well, for the great, terrible, long, slow rabble and slave rebellion: it grows and grows!</p><p>Now the lowly are outraged by all benevolence and little charities; and the super-rich should be on their guard!</p><p>Whoever dribbles these days like portly bottles with all too narrow necks \u2013 people like to break the necks of such bottles today.</p><p>Lascivious greed, galling envy, aggrieved vengefulness, rabble pride: all of that leaped into my face. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed. But the kingdom of heaven is among the cows.\u201d</p><p>\u201cAnd why is it not among the wealthy?\u201d asked Zarathustra, temptingly, as he warded off the cows that trustingly snorted at the peaceful man.</p><p>\u201cWhy do you tempt me?\u201d he answered. \u201cYou yourself know it even better than I. What drove me to the poorest, oh Zarathustra? Was it not my nausea for our wealthiest people?</p><p>\u2013 for the convicts of wealth who cull their advantage out of every dustpan, with cold eyes, horny thoughts; for this mob that stinks to high heaven,</p><p>\u2013 for this gilded, fake rabble, whose fathers were pick-pockets or vultures or rag pickers, with women who were willing, lascivious, forgetful \u2013 all of them after all are not far from being whores \u2013</p><p>rabble above, rabble below! What do \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018rich\u2019 mean anymore today! I forgot this difference \u2013 then I fled, farther, ever farther, until I got to these cows.\u201d</p><p>Thus spoke the peaceful man and he himself snorted and sweated at these words, such that the cows once again were amazed. But Zarathustra continued to look him in the face, smiling as he spoke so harshly, and he silently shook his head.</p><p>\u201cYou do violence to yourself, you mountain preacher, when you use such harsh words. Not for such harshness were your mouth or your eyes made.</p><p>Nor, it seems to me, your stomach itself: it resists all such raging and hating and foaming over. Your stomach wants gentler things: you are no butcher.</p><p>Rather, you seem to me a vegetarian and a root man. Perhaps you crunch grains. But certainly you are ill disposed toward pleasures of the flesh and you love honey.\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou guessed me well,\u201d responded the voluntary beggar, with relief in his heart. \u201cI love honey, I also crunch grains, because I sought what tastes lovely and makes for clean breath:</p><p>\u2013 also what takes a long time, a day\u2019s and mouth\u2019s work for gentle idlers and bums.</p><p>The ones who have excelled the most, to be sure, are these cows: they invented chewing the cud for themselves and lying in the sun. They also refrain from all weighty thoughts, which bloat the heart.\u201d</p><p>\u2013 \u201cWell then!\u201d said Zarathustra. \u201cYou should also see my animals, my eagle and my snake \u2013 their equal exists nowhere today on earth.</p><p>Look, there the path leads to my cave; be its guest tonight. And speak with my animals about the happiness of animals \u2013</p><p>\u2013 until I myself come home. Because now a cry of distress hurries me away from you. You\u2019ll also find new honey at my place, icy-fresh golden honey from the comb \u2013 eat it!</p><p>But now quickly take leave of your cows, you odd, you lovely man! Even if it is difficult for you. For they are your warmest friends and teachers!\u201d \u2013</p><p>\u201c\u2013 With the exception of one person, whom I love even more,\u201d answered the voluntary beggar. \u201cYou yourself are good and even better than a cow, oh Zarathustra!\u201d</p><p>\u201cAway, away with you! You nasty flatterer!\u201d cried Zarathustra with malice, \u201cwhy do you spoil me with such praise and flatter-honey?</p><p>Away, away from me!\u201d he cried once more and brandished his staff at the affectionate beggar, who ran away swiftly.</p>", "article_json": {"type": "doc", "content": [{"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 2}, "content": [{"text": "The Ugliest Human Being", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"text": "\u2013 And again Zarathustra\u2019s feet ran through mountains and woods, and his eyes searched and searched, but nowhere to be seen was the one whom they wanted to see, the great sufferer of distress and crier of distress.

But along the whole way he jubilated in his heart and was thankful. \u201cWhat good things,\u201d he said, \u201cthis day has bestowed on me, as compensation for having begun so badly! What strange interlocutors I found!\r\n\r\nNow I want to chew on their words for a long time, as on good kernels; my teeth will grind and grate them down until they flow like milk into my soul!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nBut when the path disappeared again around a boulder, all at once the landscape changed and Zarathustra stepped into a realm of death. Here black and red cliffs jutted upward: no grass, no tree, no birdsong. For it was a valley that all animals avoided, even the predators; except for a species of hideous, thick, green snakes that would come here to die when they grew old. And for this reason the shepherds called this valley: Snake Death.\r\n\r\nNow Zarathustra sank into a black reminiscence, for it seemed to him that he had already stood in this valley once before. And much graveness spread itself over his mind, such that he walked slowly and ever more slowly until finally he stood still. But then, when he opened his eyes he saw something sitting beside the path, shaped like a human but scarcely like a human, something unspeakable. And all of a sudden Zarathustra was overcome with great shame for having looked upon such a thing with his own eyes; blushing all the way up to his white hair, he averted his gaze and picked up his foot, intending to leave this wicked spot. But then a noise animated the dead wasteland; it welled up from the ground gurgling and rattling, like water gurgles and rattles at night through clogged water pipes, until finally it turned into a human voice and human speech \u2013 that sounded like this.\r\n\r\n\u201cZarathustra! Zarathustra! Guess my riddle! Speak, speak! What is revenge against the witness?\r\n\r\nI lure you back, there is slippery ice here! See to it, see to it that your pride does not break its legs here!\r\n\r\nYou consider yourself wise, you proud Zarathustra! Then go ahead and guess the riddle, you hard nut cracker \u2013 the riddle that I am! So tell me: who am I?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 But when Zarathustra had heard these words \u2013 what do you think took place in his soul? He was overwhelmed with pity; and he collapsed at once like an oak tree that has long withstood many wood cutters \u2013 heavily, suddenly, to the terror of even those who wanted to fell it. But right away he picked himself up from the ground and his face had become hard.\r\n\r\n\u201cI recognize you alright,\u201d he spoke with a voice of bronze: \u201cYou are the murderer of God! Let me go.\r\n\r\nYou could not bear the one who saw you \u2013 who saw you always and through and through, you ugliest human being! You took revenge on this witness!\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra and wanted to leave; but the unspeakable one latched on to a corner of his garment and began again to gurgle and to search for words. \u201cStay!\u201d he said at last \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cStay! Do not pass by! I guessed what kind of axe knocked you to the ground: Hail to you, oh Zarathustra, that you stand again!\r\n\r\nYou guessed, I know it well, how he who killed him feels \u2013 the murderer of God. Stay! Sit down here with me, it will not be in vain.\r\n\r\nTo whom did I want to go, if not to you? Stay, sit down! But do not look at me! Honor thus \u2013 my ugliness!\r\n\r\nThey persecute me; now you are my last refuge. Not with their hatred, not with their bailiffs \u2013 oh such persecution I would mock and be proud and glad!\r\n\r\nHas not everything successful hitherto been done by the well-persecuted? And whoever persecutes well easily learns to succeed \u2013 after all he is already \u2013 after somebody! But it\u2019s their pity \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 their pity is what I flee and why I flee to you. Oh Zarathustra, protect me, you my last refuge, you the only one to guess me:\r\n\r\n\u2013 you guessed how he who killed him feels. Stay! And if you want to go, you impatient one: do not go the way that I came. That way is bad.\r\n\r\nAre you angry with me that I\u2019ve already spoken broken words for too long? That I even counsel you? But know this, it\u2019s me, the ugliest human being,\r\n\r\n\u2013 who also has the biggest, heaviest feet. Where I walked, the way is bad. I trample all ways to death and to ruin.\r\n\r\nBut that you passed me by, silently; that you blushed, I saw it well: that\u2019s how I recognized you as Zarathustra.\r\n\r\nAny other would have tossed me his alms, his pity, with looks and speech. But for that \u2013 I am not beggar enough, you guessed that \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013for that I am too rich, rich in what is great, what is terrible, what is ugliest, what is most unspeakable! Your shame, oh Zarathustra, honored me!\r\n\r\nWith difficulty I managed to escape the throng of the pitying \u2013 to find the only one today who teaches \u2018pitying is obtrusive\u2019 \u2013 you, oh Zarathustra!\r\n\r\n\u2013 Be it a god\u2019s, be it the pity of mankind: pitying is offensive to shame. And not wanting to help can be more noble than the virtue that leaps to help.\r\n\r\nBut today that is what passes for virtue itself among all small people, pity \u2013 they have no respect for great misfortune, for great ugliness, for great failure.\r\n\r\nI look away over all these people like a dog looks away over the backs of teeming flocks of sheep. They are small, good-wooled and good-willed gray people.\r\n\r\nLike a heron looks away contemptuously over shallow ponds, its head tossed back; thus I look away over teeming gray little waves and wills and souls.\r\n\r\nThey have been deemed to be right for too long, these small people; and so in the end they were given might too \u2013 now they teach: \u2018the only good is what small people call good.\u2019\r\n\r\nAnd \u2018truth\u2019 today is what the preacher spoke, the one who himself came from among them, that odd holy man and advocate of small people who testified of himself: \u2018I \u2013 am the truth.\u2019\r\n\r\nThis immodest person has for a long time now caused small people to get big heads \u2013 he who taught no small error when he taught \u2018I \u2013 am the truth.\u2019\r\n\r\nWas an immodest person ever answered more courteously? \u2013 But you, oh Zarathustra, passed him by and said: \u2018No! No! Three times no!\u2019\r\n\r\nYou warned against his error, you were the first to warn against pity \u2013 not all, not none, but yourself and your kind.\r\n\r\nYou are ashamed of the shame of the great sufferer; and indeed, when you say \u2018from pitying a great cloud is coming, beware, you human beings!\u2019\r\n\r\n\u2013 when you teach \u2018all creators are hard, all great love is above pitying\u2019: oh Zarathustra, how well schooled you seem to me in predicting the weather!\r\n\r\nBut you yourself \u2013 warn yourself too against your pitying! Because many are on their way to you, many who are suffering, doubting, despairing, drowning, freezing \u2013\r\n\r\nI warn you against me too. You guessed my best and worst riddle, me myself and what I did. I know the axe that fells you.\r\n\r\nBut he \u2013 had to die: he saw with eyes that saw everything \u2013 he saw the depths and grounds of human beings, all their hidden disgrace and ugliness.\r\n\r\nHis pitying knew no shame: he crawled into my filthiest nook. This most curious, super-obtrusive, super-pitying one had to die.\r\n\r\nHe always saw me: I wanted revenge on such a witness \u2013 or to no longer live myself.\r\n\r\nThe god who saw everything, even human beings: this god had to die! Human beings cannot bear that such a witness lives.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke the ugliest human being. But Zarathustra rose and set about to leave, because he was chilled down to his entrails.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou unspeakable one,\u201d he said, \u201cyou warned me against your way. Out of gratitude I now commend mine to you. Look, up there lies Zarathustra\u2019s cave.\r\n\r\nMy cave is big and deep and has many nooks; there the most hidden person will find a hiding place. And close by are a hundred burrows and tunnels for crawling, flapping and leaping wildlife.\r\n\r\nYou outcast, who cast himself out, you no longer want to dwell among human beings and human pity? Well then, do as I do! Thus you\u2019ll also learn from me; only the doer learns.\r\n\r\nAnd speak first and foremost with my animals! The proudest animal and the wisest animal \u2013 they are surely the right counselors for both of us!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra and continued on his way, pensive and even more slowly than before; because he had much to ask himself and knew no easy way to answer.\r\n\r\n\u201cHow poor indeed is a human being!\u201d he thought in his heart, \u201chow ugly, how gasping, how full of concealed shame!\r\n\r\nThey tell me that human beings love themselves; oh, how great this self-love must be! How much contempt it has against it!\r\n\r\nEven this man here loved himself, as he despised himself \u2013 to me he seems a great lover and a great despiser.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve never found anyone who despised himself more deeply; that too is elevation. Oh no, was he perhaps the higher man whose cry I heard?\r\n\r\nI love the great despisers. Human being, however, is something that must be overcome.\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThe Voluntary Beggar\r\n\r\nWhen Zarathustra had left the ugliest human being, he was freezing and he felt lonely; after all, so much that was cold and lonely went through his mind, to the point where even his limbs grew colder because of it. But as he climbed further and further, up, down, now past green meadows, but then also across wild stony deposits where previously an impatient brook might have laid itself to bed, then all at once his mood became warmer and more cordial.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat happened to me?\u201d he asked himself, \u201csomething warm and lively refreshes me, something that must be close to me.\r\n\r\nAlready I am less alone; unknown companions and brothers roam around me, their warm breath touches on my soul.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut when he peered about himself and searched for the comforters of his solitude, oddly enough, it was cows huddled together on a knoll; their nearness and smell had warmed his heart. Now these cows seemed engrossed in listening to someone speaking, and they paid no attention to the one who approached them. But when Zarathustra was quite near them he heard clearly how a human voice spoke from the midst of the cows; and evidently they had all turned their heads toward the speaker.\r\n\r\nThen Zarathustra leaped up eagerly and pushed the animals apart, fearing that someone might have come to harm here, which could scarcely be remedied by the pity of cows. But in this he had deceived himself; for indeed, there sat someone on the ground and appeared to be persuading the animals to not be afraid of him, a peaceful man and mountain preacher from whose eyes goodness itself preached. \u201cWhat are you seeking here?\u201d cried Zarathustra, astonished.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat am I seeking here?\u201d he answered: \u201cThe same thing you seek, you trouble maker! Namely happiness on earth.\r\n\r\nBut for that I want to learn from these cows. And you should know, I\u2019ve already persuaded them half the morning, and just now they wanted to tell me for sure. Why do you have to disturb them?\r\n\r\nUnless we are converted and become as cows, we will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. For there is one thing that we ought to learn from them: chewing the cud.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and did not learn this one thing, chewing the cud: what would it help? He would not be rid of his misery\r\n\r\n\u2013 his great misery: which today is called nausea. Who today does not have heart, mouth and eyes full of nausea? You too! You too! But just look at these cows here!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke the mountain preacher and then he turned his own gaze on Zarathustra \u2013 for till now his gaze hung lovingly on the cows \u2013 then, however, it transformed. \u201cWho is this with whom I speak?\u201d he cried, startled, and jumped up from the ground.\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is the man without nausea, this is Zarathustra himself, the one who overcame great nausea, this is the eye, this is the mouth, this is the heart of Zarathustra himself.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd while he spoke thus he kissed the hands of the one to whom he spoke, and tears streamed from his eyes, and he behaved quite like someone to whom a precious gift and treasure falls unexpectedly from heaven. The cows, meanwhile, watched all of this and were amazed.\r\n\r\n\u201cDo not speak of me, you odd, you lovely man!\u201d said Zarathustra and he restrained his tenderness. \u201cTell me first about yourself ! Are you not the voluntary beggar who once threw away great wealth \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 who once was ashamed of his wealth and of the wealthy, and fled to the poorest people, to give them his fullness and his heart? But they did not accept him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cBut they did not accept me,\u201d said the voluntary beggar, \u201cyou know it already. So in the end I went to the animals and to these cows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you learned,\u201d Zarathustra interrupted the speaker, \u201chow it is harder to grant right than to take right, and that bestowing well is an art and the ultimate, craftiest master-art of kindness.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cEspecially nowadays,\u201d answered the voluntary beggar. \u201cNowadays, namely, where everything lowly has become rebellious and skittish and haughty in its own way: namely in a rabble way.\r\n\r\nFor the hour has come, you know it well, for the great, terrible, long, slow rabble and slave rebellion: it grows and grows!\r\n\r\nNow the lowly are outraged by all benevolence and little charities; and the super-rich should be on their guard!\r\n\r\nWhoever dribbles these days like portly bottles with all too narrow necks \u2013 people like to break the necks of such bottles today.\r\n\r\nLascivious greed, galling envy, aggrieved vengefulness, rabble pride: all of that leaped into my face. It is no longer true that the poor are blessed. But the kingdom of heaven is among the cows.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd why is it not among the wealthy?\u201d asked Zarathustra, temptingly, as he warded off the cows that trustingly snorted at the peaceful man.\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy do you tempt me?\u201d he answered. \u201cYou yourself know it even better than I. What drove me to the poorest, oh Zarathustra? Was it not my nausea for our wealthiest people?\r\n\r\n\u2013 for the convicts of wealth who cull their advantage out of every dustpan, with cold eyes, horny thoughts; for this mob that stinks to high heaven,\r\n\r\n\u2013 for this gilded, fake rabble, whose fathers were pick-pockets or vultures or rag pickers, with women who were willing, lascivious, forgetful \u2013 all of them after all are not far from being whores \u2013\r\n\r\nrabble above, rabble below! What do \u2018poor\u2019 and \u2018rich\u2019 mean anymore today! I forgot this difference \u2013 then I fled, farther, ever farther, until I got to these cows.\u201d\r\n\r\nThus spoke the peaceful man and he himself snorted and sweated at these words, such that the cows once again were amazed. But Zarathustra continued to look him in the face, smiling as he spoke so harshly, and he silently shook his head.\r\n\r\n\u201cYou do violence to yourself, you mountain preacher, when you use such harsh words. Not for such harshness were your mouth or your eyes made.\r\n\r\nNor, it seems to me, your stomach itself: it resists all such raging and hating and foaming over. Your stomach wants gentler things: you are no butcher.\r\n\r\nRather, you seem to me a vegetarian and a root man. Perhaps you crunch grains. But certainly you are ill disposed toward pleasures of the flesh and you love honey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou guessed me well,\u201d responded the voluntary beggar, with relief in his heart. \u201cI love honey, I also crunch grains, because I sought what tastes lovely and makes for clean breath:\r\n\r\n\u2013 also what takes a long time, a day\u2019s and mouth\u2019s work for gentle idlers and bums.\r\n\r\nThe ones who have excelled the most, to be sure, are these cows: they invented chewing the cud for themselves and lying in the sun. They also refrain from all weighty thoughts, which bloat the heart.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cWell then!\u201d said Zarathustra. \u201cYou should also see my animals, my eagle and my snake \u2013 their equal exists nowhere today on earth.\r\n\r\nLook, there the path leads to my cave; be its guest tonight. And speak with my animals about the happiness of animals \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 until I myself come home. Because now a cry of distress hurries me away from you. You\u2019ll also find new honey at my place, icy-fresh golden honey from the comb \u2013 eat it!\r\n\r\nBut now quickly take leave of your cows, you odd, you lovely man! Even if it is difficult for you. For they are your warmest friends and teachers!\u201d \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201c\u2013 With the exception of one person, whom I love even more,\u201d answered the voluntary beggar. \u201cYou yourself are good and even better than a cow, oh Zarathustra!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAway, away with you! You nasty flatterer!\u201d cried Zarathustra with malice, \u201cwhy do you spoil me with such praise and flatter-honey?\r\n\r\nAway, away from me!\u201d he cried once more and brandished his staff at the affectionate beggar, who ran away swiftly."}, "id": 85}, {"data": {"uuid": "71a2c65d-c4c7-4ef2-8820-4d48240f0eeb", "user": 1, "title": "The Shadow", "created_on": "2023-05-10 16:56:10.320550+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 16:56:10.343237+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Shadow</h2><p>But scarcely had the voluntary beggar run away and Zarathustra was again alone with himself, than he heard a new voice behind him, crying \u201cStop!

But as he stood facing the cave, not more than twenty paces away from it, something happened that he least expected now: once again he heard the great cry of distress. And, amazingly, this time it came from his own cave! But it was a protracted, manifold, peculiar cry, and Zarathustra clearly differentiated that it was composed of many voices; even if, heard from a distance, it sounded like the cry of a single mouth.</p><p>Then Zarathustra bounded toward his cave, and behold, what an eyeful awaited him after this earful! Indeed, there sitting all together were the ones he had passed by during the day: the king on the right and king on the left, the old magician, the pope, the voluntary beggar, the shadow, the conscientious of spirit, the sad soothsayer and the ass; the ugliest human being, however, had donned a crown and draped two purple sashes around himself \u2013 for like all ugly people he loved to disguise himself and act beautiful. But in the midst of this gloomy company stood Zarathustra\u2019s eagle, bristling and restless because he was pressed to answer too much for which his pride had no answer; meanwhile the wise snake hung around his neck.</p><p>All of this Zarathustra observed with great amazement; then he examined each one of his guests with affable curiosity, read their souls and was amazed once more. In the meantime the assembled had risen from their seats and they waited respectfully for Zarathustra to speak. But Zarathustra spoke thus:</p><p>\u201cYou despairing ones! You strange ones! So it was your cry of distress I heard? And now I also know where to find the one whom I have sought in vain today: the higher man \u2013 :</p><p>\u2013 in my own cave he\u2019s sitting, the higher man! But why am I amazed? Did I myself not lure him to me with honey sacrifices and the cunning calls of my happiness?</p><p>Yet it seems to me you are not fit company for each other; sitting here together you strain each other\u2019s nerves, you criers of distress. First someone has to come,</p><p>\u2013 someone to make you laugh again, a good gay buffoon, a dancer and a wind and wildcat, some old fool \u2013 what do you think?</p><p>Forgive me please, you despairing ones, for speaking to you with such small words, unworthy, truly, of such guests! But you cannot guess what makes my heart so mischievous \u2013</p><p>You yourselves are responsible, and how you look, forgive me! After all, everyone who looks at a despairing person becomes mischievous. To give encouragement to someone who despairs \u2013 for that everyone thinks they\u2019re strong enough.</p><p>You yourselves gave me this strength \u2013 a good gift, my elevated guests! A righteous gift for your host! Well then, don\u2019t be angry now when I offer you something of my own.</p><p>This here is my kingdom and my dominion; but whatever is mine shall be yours for this evening and this night. My animals shall serve you; my cave shall be your resting place!</p><p>In my home and house no one shall despair; in my territory I protect everyone from his wild animals. And that is the first thing I offer you: security!</p><p>But the second thing is: my little finger. And once you\u2019ve got hold of it, just go ahead and take the whole hand! And my heart too! Welcome to this place, welcome, my guests! \u201d</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra and he laughed with love and malice. After this welcome his guests bowed repeatedly and maintained a respectful silence; then the king on the right responded in their name.</p><p>\u201cBy the manner, oh Zarathustra, that you offered us your hand and your greeting, we recognize you as Zarathustra. You humbled yourself before us; you almost offended our sense of respect \u2013</p><p>\u2013 but who is able to humble himself like you with such pride? That in itself uplifts us, it refreshes our eyes and hearts.</p><p>To behold this alone we would have gladly climbed higher mountains than this one here. We came hungry for something to behold, we wanted to see what brightens gloomy eyes.</p><p>And behold, already we have ceased all our crying of distress. Already our minds and hearts stand open and are delighted. Little is missing and our spirits will become spirited.</p><p>Nothing more delightful grows on earth, oh Zarathustra, than a tall, strong will: that is the earth\u2019s most beautiful plant. An entire landscape is invigorated by one such tree.</p><p>Whoever grows tall like you, oh Zarathustra, I compare to the stone-pine: long, silent, hard, solitary, of the most resilient wood, magnificent \u2013</p><p>\u2013 but in the end reaching out with strong green branches for its dominion, asking strong questions before the winds and weather and whatever else is at home in the heights,</p><p>\u2013 answering even more strongly, a commander, a victor: oh who would not climb high mountains to look upon such plants?</p><p>Even the gloomy, the failures are invigorated by your tree, oh Zarathustra, even the hearts of the unsteady are made sure and are healed at the sight of you.</p><p>And truly, many eyes today are trained on your mountain and tree; a great longing has opened up, and many have learned to ask: who is Zarathustra?</p><p>And those into whose ears you ever dripped your song and your honey: all the hidden ones, the solitary and the dualitary, said at once to their hearts:</p><p>\u2018Does Zarathustra still live? It\u2019s not worth it anymore to live, all is the same, all is in vain: or \u2013 we must live with Zarathustra!\u2019</p><p>\u2018Why does he not come, he who announced himself for so long?\u2019 thus many ask. \u2018Did solitude swallow him up? Or should we perhaps go to him?\u2019</p><p>Now it happens that solitude itself is becoming brittle and is breaking apart, like a grave that breaks open and can no longer contain its dead.

And in you, too, there is much that makes me love and hope.</p><p>That you despise, you higher men, that makes me hope. For the great despisers are the great reverers.</p><p>That you have despaired, there is much to revere in that. For you did not learn how to surrender, you did not learn petty prudence.</p><p>For today the little people have become ruler: they all preach surrender and resignation and prudence and industry and consideration and the long etcetera of little virtues.</p><p>What is effeminate, what comes from the servant\u2019s ilk and especially the rabble mishmash: that now wants to become ruler of all human destiny \u2013 oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea!</p><p>That asks and asks and does not tire: \u201cHow do human beings preserve themselves best, longest, most pleasantly?\u201d With that \u2013 they are the rulers of today.</p><p>Overcome these rulers of today for me, oh my brothers \u2013 these little people: they are the overman\u2019s greatest danger!</p><p>Overcome for me, you higher men, the little virtues, the little prudence, the sand-grain sized considerations, the detritus of swarming ants, the pitiful contentedness, the \u201chappiness of the greatest number\u201d!</p><p>And despair rather than surrender. And truly, I love you for not knowing how to live today, you higher men! For thus you live \u2013 best!</p><h3>4</h3><p>Do you have courage, oh my brothers? Are you brave of heart? Not courage before witnesses, but the courage of hermits and eagles, which not even a god looks at anymore.</p><p>Cold souls, mules, the blind, the drunk \u2013 these I do not call brave of heart. Whoever has heart knows fear, but conquers fear; sees the abyss, but with pride.</p><p>Whoever sees the abyss, but with eagle\u2019s eyes, whoever grasps the abyss with eagle\u2019s talons: he has courage. \u2013</p><h3>5</h3><p>\u201cHuman beings are evil\u201d \u2013 thus spoke all the wisest to comfort me.

What is most evil is necessary for the overman\u2019s best.</p><p>It may have been good for that preacher of the little people that he suffered and labored under the sins of mankind. But I enjoy the greatest sin as my greatest comfort. \u2013</p><p>But such things are not said for long ears. Every word does not belong in every snout. These are fine and faraway things: sheeps\u2019 hooves should not reach for them!</p><h3>6</h3><p>You higher men, do you think I am here to make good what you made bad?</p><p>Or that I have come henceforth to bed you suffering ones more comfortably? Or to show new, easier paths to those of you who are unsteady, lost, and have climbed astray?</p><p>No! No! Three times no! Ever more, ever better of your kind shall perish \u2013 for you shall have it ever worse and ever harder. Only thus \u2013</p><p>\u2013 only thus do human beings grow into that height, where lightning strikes and breaks them: high enough for lightning!</p><p>My mind and my longing are trained on the few, the long, the distant: what do I care about your many little brief miseries?</p><p>You do not suffer enough in my opinion! For you suffer from yourselves, you haven\u2019t yet suffered from human beings. And you would be lying if you said otherwise! All of you do not suffer from what I suffered. \u2013</p><h3>7</h3><p>It is not enough for me that lightning no longer causes damage. I do not want to divert it: it shall learn to work \u2013 for me.</p><p>My wisdom has gathered itself for a long time like a cloud, it becomes stiller and darker. Thus does every wisdom that shall one day give birth to lightning.</p><p>To these people of today I do not want to be light, nor be called light. Them \u2013 I want to blind: lightning of my wisdom \u2013 put out their eyes!</p><h3>8</h3><p>Will nothing beyond your capacity: there is a wicked falseness among those who will beyond their capacity.</p><p>Especially when they will great things! For they arouse mistrust against great things, these fine counterfeiters and actors \u2013</p><p>\u2013 until at last they are false before themselves, cross-eyed, white-washed worm food, cloaked by strong words, by showy virtues, by gleaming false works.</p><p>Be very careful there, you higher men! For I regard nothing more precious and rare today than honesty.</p><p>Is this today not of the rabble? But rabble does not know what is great, what is small, what is straight and honest: it is innocently crooked, it always lies.</p><h3>9</h3><p>Have a good mistrust today, you higher men, you brave-hearted, you open-hearted ones! And keep your grounds secret! For this today is of the rabble.</p><p>What the rabble once learned to believe without grounds, how could anyone overthrow that with grounds?</p><p>In the market place one convinces with gestures. But grounds make the rabble mistrustful.</p><p>And if ever truth was victorious there, then ask yourselves with good mistrust: \u201cWhich strong error fought for it?\u201d</p><p>And beware also of the scholars! They hate you, because they are sterile! They have cold, dried up eyes; before them every bird lies plucked.</p><p>Such types boast that they do not lie: but powerlessness to lie is by no means love for the truth. Beware!</p><p>Freedom from fever is by no means knowledge! I do not believe spirits that have cooled down. Whoever cannot lie does not know what truth is.</p><h3>10</h3><p>If you want to climb high and beyond, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves be carried up, do not seat yourselves on strangers\u2019 backs and heads!</p><p>But you mount your horse? You ride swiftly up to your goal? Well then, my friend! But your lame foot is also mounted on your horse!</p><p>When you\u2019ve reached your goal, when you leap from your horse, precisely at your height, you higher man \u2013 you will stumble!</p><h3>11</h3><p>You creators, you higher men! One is pregnant only with one\u2019s own child.</p><p>Do not let yourselves be misled and spoon-fed! Who after all is your neighbor? And even if you act \u201cfor your neighbor\u201d \u2013 still you don\u2019t create for him!</p><p>Unlearn this \u201cfor,\u201d you creators; your virtue itself wants that you do nothing \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cin order\u201d and \u201cbecause.\u201d You should plug your ears against these false little words.</p><p>\u201cFor your neighbor\u201d is the virtue of only small people; there they say \u201cbirds of a feather\u201d and \u201cone hand washes the other\u201d \u2013 they have neither the right nor the strength to your self-interest.</p><p>In your self-interest, you creators, are the precaution and providence of the pregnant! What no one yet has laid eyes on, the fruit: your whole love shelters and spares and nourishes it.</p><p>Where your whole love is, with your children, there too your whole virtue is! Your work, your will is your \u201cneighbor\u201d \u2013 do not let yourself be spoon-fed any false values!</p><h3>12</h3><p>You creators, you higher men! Whoever must give birth is sick; but whoever has given birth, is unclean.</p><p>Ask women: one does not give birth because it is enjoyable. Pain makes hens and poets cackle.</p><p>You creators, in you there is much that is unclean. That\u2019s because you had to be mothers.</p><p>A new child \u2013 oh how much new filth also came into the world! Step aside! And whoever has given birth should wash his soul clean!</p><h3>13</h3><p>Do not be virtuous beyond your strengths! And will nothing of yourselves that is contrary to probability!</p><p>Walk in the footsteps where your fathers\u2019 virtue walked before! How could you climb high if your fathers\u2019 will did not climb with you?</p><p>But whoever would be a firstling should see to it that he does not also become a lastling! And where the vices of your fathers are, there you should not pretend to be saints!</p><p>If your fathers took to women and strong wine and boar swine, what would be the use of demanding chastity of yourself?</p><p>It would be a folly! To me it truly seems like much if such a man belonged to one or two or three women.</p><p>And if he founded monasteries and wrote above the door: \u201cThis way to sainthood\u201d \u2013 I would still say: What for! It\u2019s a new folly!</p><p>He founded himself a guardhouse and safeguard: good for him! But I don\u2019t believe in it.</p><p>Whatever one brings into solitude grows in it, even the inner beast. On this score, solitude is ill-advised for many.</p><p>Was there ever anything filthier on earth than saints of the wilderness? Around them not only hell broke loose \u2013 but pigs too.</p><h3>14</h3><p>Timid, ashamed, awkward, like a tiger whose leap has failed; thus, you higher men, I often saw you slinking aside. A throw failed you.</p><p>But what does it matter, you dice throwers! You did not learn to gamble and banter as one should gamble and banter! Are we not always sitting at a great bantering and gaming table?</p><p>And when something great failed you, are you yourselves therefore \u2013 failures? And if you yourselves failed, did humanity therefore fail? But if humanity failed: well then, well now!</p><h3>15</h3><p>The higher its kind, the more seldom a thing succeeds. You higher men here, haven\u2019t all of you \u2013 failed?</p><p>Be of good cheer, what does it matter! How much is still possible! Learn to laugh at yourselves as one must laugh!</p><p>And no wonder that you failed and half succeeded, you half-broken ones! Does humanity\u2019s future not push and shove within you?</p><p>What is most distant, deepest, highest to the stars in humanity, its prodigious power: does all that not foam against each other in your pot?</p><p>No wonder many a pot breaks! Learn to laugh at yourselves as one must laugh! You higher men, oh how much is still possible!</p><p>And truly, how much has succeeded already! How rich is this earth in small, good, perfect things, in things that turned out well!</p><p>Place small, good, perfect things around you, you higher men! Their golden ripeness heals the heart. Perfection teaches us to hope.</p><h3>16</h3><p>What was the greatest sin here on earth until now? Was it not the words of him who spoke: \u201cWoe to you who laugh now!\u201d</p><p>Did he himself find no reasons to laugh on earth? Then he searched badly. Even a child finds reasons here.</p><p>He \u2013 did not love enough; or else he would have loved us too, we who laugh! But he hated and heckled us, howling and gnashing of teeth he heralded for us.</p><p>Must one curse right away where one does not love? That \u2013 seems to me in bad taste. But that is how he acted, this unconditional one. He came from the rabble.</p><p>And he himself just did not love enough; or else he would have been less angry that people did not love him. All great love does not want love \u2013 it wants more.</p><p>Get out of the way of all such unconditional ones! That is a poor sick kind, a rabble kind; they look harshly at this life, they have the evil eye for this earth.</p><p>Get out of the way of all such unconditional ones! They have heavy feet and sultry hearts \u2013 they do not know how to dance. How could the earth be light to them?</p><h3>17</h3><p>Crookedly all good things approach their goal. Like cats they arch their backs, they purr inwardly with their impending happiness \u2013 all good things laugh.</p><p>A person\u2019s stride betrays whether one is striding on his course: just look at me walk! But whoever approaches his goal dances.</p><p>And truly, I have not become a statue, I do not yet stand there stiff, stunned, stony, a column; I love swift running.</p><p>And even though there are bogs and thick depressions on earth, who- ever has light feet runs over and past the mud and dances as if on clean- swept ice.</p><p>Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And don\u2019t forget your legs either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better still: stand on your heads too!</p><h3>18</h3><p>This crown of the laughing one, this rose-wreath crown \u2013 I myself put on this crown, I myself pronounced my laughter holy. I found no other strong enough for it today.</p><p>Zarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one who waves with his wings, the flightworthy, waving to all birds, worthy and ready, a blissful lightweight \u2013</p><p>Zarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the soothlaugher, not impatient, not unconditional, someone who loves capers and escapades; I myself put on this crown!</p><h3>19</h3><p>Lift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And don\u2019t forget your legs either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better still: stand on your heads too!</p><p>Even in happiness there are heavy creatures, there are born ponderipedes. Quaintly they struggle, like an elephant struggling to stand on its head.</p><p>But it is better to be foolish with happiness than foolish with unhappiness, better to dance ponderously than to walk lamely. So learn this wisdom from me: even the worst thing has two good reverse sides \u2013</p><p>\u2013 even the worst thing has good legs for dancing: so learn from me, you higher men, to stand yourselves on your right legs!</p><p>So unlearn moping and all rabble sadness! Oh how sad even today\u2019s rabble clowns seem to me! But this today is of the rabble.</p><h3>20</h3><p>Make like the wind when he plunges from his mountain caves: he wants to dance to his own pipe, the seas tremble and skip under his footsteps.</p><p>Praised be this good unruly spirit who gives wings to asses and milks the lionesses, who comes upon all that is today and all rabble like a storm wind \u2013</p><p>\u2013 who is hostile to thistle-heads and hair-splitters and all wilted leaves and weeds: praised be this good, free storm spirit, who dances on bogs and depressions as upon meadows!</p><p>Who hates the rabble\u2019s mindless swindlers and all botched gloomy brood: praised be this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing storm who blows dust into the eyes of all fusspots and pus-pots!</p><p>You higher men, your worst part is that all of you have not learned to dance as one must dance \u2013 dance over and past yourselves! What does it matter that you didn\u2019t turn out well?</p><p>How much is still possible! So learn to laugh over and past yourselves! Lift up your hearts, you good dancers, high! higher! And don\u2019t forget good laughter either!</p><p>This crown of the laughing one, this rose-wreath crown: to you, my brothers, I throw this crown! I pronounced laughter holy; you higher men, learn \u2013 to laugh!</p>", "article_json": {"type": "doc", "content": [{"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 2}, "content": [{"text": "On the Higher Man", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "heading", "attrs": {"level": 3}, "content": [{"text": "1", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"text": "When I came to mankind for the first time, I committed the hermit\u2019s folly, the great folly: I situated myself in the market place.", "type": "text"}]}, {"type": "paragraph", "content": [{"text": "And when I spoke to all, I spoke to none.

But by evening my companions were tightrope walkers, and corpses, and I myself almost a corpse.\r\n\r\nBut with the new morning a new truth came to me; then I learned to say: \u201cWhat do the market place and the rabble and the rabble noise and long rabble ears matter to me!\u201d\r\n\r\nYou higher men, learn this from me: in the market place no one believes in higher men. And if you want to speak there, well then! But the rabble blinks \u201cwe are all equal.\r\n\r\nYou higher men\u201d \u2013 thus blinks the rabble \u2013 \u201cthere are no higher men, we are all equal, human is human, before God \u2013 we are all equal!\u201d\r\n\r\nBefore God! \u2013 Now, however, this God has died. But we do not want to be equal before the rabble. You higher men, go away from the market place!\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBefore God! \u2013 But now this god has died! You higher men, this god was your greatest danger.\r\n\r\nIt is only now, since he lies in his grave, that you are resurrected. Only now the great noon comes, only now the higher man becomes \u2013 ruler!\r\n\r\nHave you understood these words, oh my brothers? You are frightened; do your hearts become dizzy? Does the abyss yawn before you here? Does the hell hound yelp before you here?\r\n\r\nWell then! Well now! You higher men! Only now is the mountain in labor with humanity\u2019s future. God died: now we want \u2013 the overman to live.\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThose who care most today ask: \u201cHow are human beings to be preserved?\u201d But Zarathustra is the only one and the first one to ask: \u201cHow shall human being be overcome?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe overman is in my heart, that is my first and my only concern \u2013 and not human beings; not the neighbor, not the poorest, not the most suffering, not the best \u2013\r\n\r\nOh my brothers, what I am able to love in human beings is that they are a going over and a going under. And in you, too, there is much that makes me love and hope.\r\n\r\nThat you despise, you higher men, that makes me hope. For the great despisers are the great reverers.\r\n\r\nThat you have despaired, there is much to revere in that. For you did not learn how to surrender, you did not learn petty prudence.\r\n\r\nFor today the little people have become ruler: they all preach surrender and resignation and prudence and industry and consideration and the long etcetera of little virtues.\r\n\r\nWhat is effeminate, what comes from the servant\u2019s ilk and especially the rabble mishmash: that now wants to become ruler of all human destiny \u2013 oh nausea! Nausea! Nausea!\r\n\r\nThat asks and asks and does not tire: \u201cHow do human beings preserve themselves best, longest, most pleasantly?\u201d With that \u2013 they are the rulers of today.\r\n\r\nOvercome these rulers of today for me, oh my brothers \u2013 these little people: they are the overman\u2019s greatest danger!\r\n\r\nOvercome for me, you higher men, the little virtues, the little prudence, the sand-grain sized considerations, the detritus of swarming ants, the pitiful contentedness, the \u201chappiness of the greatest number\u201d!\r\n\r\nAnd despair rather than surrender. And truly, I love you for not knowing how to live today, you higher men! For thus you live \u2013 best!\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\nDo you have courage, oh my brothers? Are you brave of heart? Not courage before witnesses, but the courage of hermits and eagles, which not even a god looks at anymore.\r\n\r\nCold souls, mules, the blind, the drunk \u2013 these I do not call brave of heart. Whoever has heart knows fear, but conquers fear; sees the abyss, but with pride.\r\n\r\nWhoever sees the abyss, but with eagle\u2019s eyes, whoever grasps the abyss with eagle\u2019s talons: he has courage. \u2013\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\u201cHuman beings are evil\u201d \u2013 thus spoke all the wisest to comfort me. Oh, if only it were still true today! Because evil is a human being\u2019s best power.\r\n\r\n\u201cMankind must become better and more evil\u201d \u2013 thus I teach. What is most evil is necessary for the overman\u2019s best.\r\n\r\nIt may have been good for that preacher of the little people that he suffered and labored under the sins of mankind. But I enjoy the greatest sin as my greatest comfort. \u2013\r\n\r\nBut such things are not said for long ears. Every word does not belong in every snout. These are fine and faraway things: sheeps\u2019 hooves should not reach for them!\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nYou higher men, do you think I am here to make good what you made bad?\r\n\r\nOr that I have come henceforth to bed you suffering ones more comfortably? Or to show new, easier paths to those of you who are unsteady, lost, and have climbed astray?\r\n\r\nNo! No! Three times no! Ever more, ever better of your kind shall perish \u2013 for you shall have it ever worse and ever harder. Only thus \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 only thus do human beings grow into that height, where lightning strikes and breaks them: high enough for lightning!\r\n\r\nMy mind and my longing are trained on the few, the long, the distant: what do I care about your many little brief miseries?\r\n\r\nYou do not suffer enough in my opinion! For you suffer from yourselves, you haven\u2019t yet suffered from human beings. And you would be lying if you said otherwise! All of you do not suffer from what I suffered. \u2013\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nIt is not enough for me that lightning no longer causes damage. I do not want to divert it: it shall learn to work \u2013 for me.\r\n\r\nMy wisdom has gathered itself for a long time like a cloud, it becomes stiller and darker. Thus does every wisdom that shall one day give birth to lightning.\r\n\r\nTo these people of today I do not want to be light, nor be called light. Them \u2013 I want to blind: lightning of my wisdom \u2013 put out their eyes!\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nWill nothing beyond your capacity: there is a wicked falseness among those who will beyond their capacity.\r\n\r\nEspecially when they will great things! For they arouse mistrust against great things, these fine counterfeiters and actors \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 until at last they are false before themselves, cross-eyed, white-washed worm food, cloaked by strong words, by showy virtues, by gleaming false works.\r\n\r\nBe very careful there, you higher men! For I regard nothing more precious and rare today than honesty.\r\n\r\nIs this today not of the rabble? But rabble does not know what is great, what is small, what is straight and honest: it is innocently crooked, it always lies.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nHave a good mistrust today, you higher men, you brave-hearted, you open-hearted ones! And keep your grounds secret! For this today is of the rabble.\r\n\r\nWhat the rabble once learned to believe without grounds, how could anyone overthrow that with grounds?\r\n\r\nIn the market place one convinces with gestures. But grounds make the rabble mistrustful.\r\n\r\nAnd if ever truth was victorious there, then ask yourselves with good mistrust: \u201cWhich strong error fought for it?\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd beware also of the scholars! They hate you, because they are sterile! They have cold, dried up eyes; before them every bird lies plucked.\r\n\r\nSuch types boast that they do not lie: but powerlessness to lie is by no means love for the truth. Beware!\r\n\r\nFreedom from fever is by no means knowledge! I do not believe spirits that have cooled down. Whoever cannot lie does not know what truth is.\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nIf you want to climb high and beyond, then use your own legs! Do not let yourselves be carried up, do not seat yourselves on strangers\u2019 backs and heads!\r\n\r\nBut you mount your horse? You ride swiftly up to your goal? Well then, my friend! But your lame foot is also mounted on your horse!\r\n\r\nWhen you\u2019ve reached your goal, when you leap from your horse, precisely at your height, you higher man \u2013 you will stumble!\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nYou creators, you higher men! One is pregnant only with one\u2019s own child.\r\n\r\nDo not let yourselves be misled and spoon-fed! Who after all is your neighbor? And even if you act \u201cfor your neighbor\u201d \u2013 still you don\u2019t create for him!\r\n\r\nUnlearn this \u201cfor,\u201d you creators; your virtue itself wants that you do nothing \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cin order\u201d and \u201cbecause.\u201d You should plug your ears against these false little words.\r\n\r\n\u201cFor your neighbor\u201d is the virtue of only small people; there they say \u201cbirds of a feather\u201d and \u201cone hand washes the other\u201d \u2013 they have neither the right nor the strength to your self-interest.\r\n\r\nIn your self-interest, you creators, are the precaution and providence of the pregnant! What no one yet has laid eyes on, the fruit: your whole love shelters and spares and nourishes it.\r\n\r\nWhere your whole love is, with your children, there too your whole virtue is! Your work, your will is your \u201cneighbor\u201d \u2013 do not let yourself be spoon-fed any false values!\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nYou creators, you higher men! Whoever must give birth is sick; but whoever has given birth, is unclean.\r\n\r\nAsk women: one does not give birth because it is enjoyable. Pain makes hens and poets cackle.\r\n\r\nYou creators, in you there is much that is unclean. That\u2019s because you had to be mothers.\r\n\r\nA new child \u2013 oh how much new filth also came into the world! Step aside! And whoever has given birth should wash his soul clean!\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\nDo not be virtuous beyond your strengths! And will nothing of yourselves that is contrary to probability!\r\n\r\nWalk in the footsteps where your fathers\u2019 virtue walked before! How could you climb high if your fathers\u2019 will did not climb with you?\r\n\r\nBut whoever would be a firstling should see to it that he does not also become a lastling! And where the vices of your fathers are, there you should not pretend to be saints!\r\n\r\nIf your fathers took to women and strong wine and boar swine, what would be the use of demanding chastity of yourself?\r\n\r\nIt would be a folly! To me it truly seems like much if such a man belonged to one or two or three women.\r\n\r\nAnd if he founded monasteries and wrote above the door: \u201cThis way to sainthood\u201d \u2013 I would still say: What for! It\u2019s a new folly!\r\n\r\nHe founded himself a guardhouse and safeguard: good for him! But I don\u2019t believe in it.\r\n\r\nWhatever one brings into solitude grows in it, even the inner beast. On this score, solitude is ill-advised for many.\r\n\r\nWas there ever anything filthier on earth than saints of the wilderness? Around them not only hell broke loose \u2013 but pigs too.\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nTimid, ashamed, awkward, like a tiger whose leap has failed; thus, you higher men, I often saw you slinking aside. A throw failed you.\r\n\r\nBut what does it matter, you dice throwers! You did not learn to gamble and banter as one should gamble and banter! Are we not always sitting at a great bantering and gaming table?\r\n\r\nAnd when something great failed you, are you yourselves therefore \u2013 failures? And if you yourselves failed, did humanity therefore fail? But if humanity failed: well then, well now!\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nThe higher its kind, the more seldom a thing succeeds. You higher men here, haven\u2019t all of you \u2013 failed?\r\n\r\nBe of good cheer, what does it matter! How much is still possible! Learn to laugh at yourselves as one must laugh!\r\n\r\nAnd no wonder that you failed and half succeeded, you half-broken ones! Does humanity\u2019s future not push and shove within you?\r\n\r\nWhat is most distant, deepest, highest to the stars in humanity, its prodigious power: does all that not foam against each other in your pot?\r\n\r\nNo wonder many a pot breaks! Learn to laugh at yourselves as one must laugh! You higher men, oh how much is still possible!\r\n\r\nAnd truly, how much has succeeded already! How rich is this earth in small, good, perfect things, in things that turned out well!\r\n\r\nPlace small, good, perfect things around you, you higher men! Their golden ripeness heals the heart. Perfection teaches us to hope.\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nWhat was the greatest sin here on earth until now? Was it not the words of him who spoke: \u201cWoe to you who laugh now!\u201d\r\n\r\nDid he himself find no reasons to laugh on earth? Then he searched badly. Even a child finds reasons here.\r\n\r\nHe \u2013 did not love enough; or else he would have loved us too, we who laugh! But he hated and heckled us, howling and gnashing of teeth he heralded for us.\r\n\r\nMust one curse right away where one does not love? That \u2013 seems to me in bad taste. But that is how he acted, this unconditional one. He came from the rabble.\r\n\r\nAnd he himself just did not love enough; or else he would have been less angry that people did not love him. All great love does not want love \u2013 it wants more.\r\n\r\nGet out of the way of all such unconditional ones! That is a poor sick kind, a rabble kind; they look harshly at this life, they have the evil eye for this earth.\r\n\r\nGet out of the way of all such unconditional ones! They have heavy feet and sultry hearts \u2013 they do not know how to dance. How could the earth be light to them?\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\nCrookedly all good things approach their goal. Like cats they arch their backs, they purr inwardly with their impending happiness \u2013 all good things laugh.\r\n\r\nA person\u2019s stride betrays whether one is striding on his course: just look at me walk! But whoever approaches his goal dances.\r\n\r\nAnd truly, I have not become a statue, I do not yet stand there stiff, stunned, stony, a column; I love swift running.\r\n\r\nAnd even though there are bogs and thick depressions on earth, who- ever has light feet runs over and past the mud and dances as if on clean- swept ice.\r\n\r\nLift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And don\u2019t forget your legs either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better still: stand on your heads too!\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\nThis crown of the laughing one, this rose-wreath crown \u2013 I myself put on this crown, I myself pronounced my laughter holy. I found no other strong enough for it today.\r\n\r\nZarathustra the dancer, Zarathustra the light one who waves with his wings, the flightworthy, waving to all birds, worthy and ready, a blissful lightweight \u2013\r\n\r\nZarathustra the soothsayer, Zarathustra the soothlaugher, not impatient, not unconditional, someone who loves capers and escapades; I myself put on this crown!\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nLift up your hearts, my brothers, high! higher! And don\u2019t forget your legs either! Lift up your legs as well, you good dancers, and better still: stand on your heads too!\r\n\r\nEven in happiness there are heavy creatures, there are born ponderipedes. Quaintly they struggle, like an elephant struggling to stand on its head.\r\n\r\nBut it is better to be foolish with happiness than foolish with unhappiness, better to dance ponderously than to walk lamely. So learn this wisdom from me: even the worst thing has two good reverse sides \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 even the worst thing has good legs for dancing: so learn from me, you higher men, to stand yourselves on your right legs!\r\n\r\nSo unlearn moping and all rabble sadness! Oh how sad even today\u2019s rabble clowns seem to me! But this today is of the rabble.\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nMake like the wind when he plunges from his mountain caves: he wants to dance to his own pipe, the seas tremble and skip under his footsteps.\r\n\r\nPraised be this good unruly spirit who gives wings to asses and milks the lionesses, who comes upon all that is today and all rabble like a storm wind \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 who is hostile to thistle-heads and hair-splitters and all wilted leaves and weeds: praised be this good, free storm spirit, who dances on bogs and depressions as upon meadows!\r\n\r\nWho hates the rabble\u2019s mindless swindlers and all botched gloomy brood: praised be this spirit of all free spirits, the laughing storm who blows dust into the eyes of all fusspots and pus-pots!\r\n\r\nYou higher men, your worst part is that all of you have not learned to dance as one must dance \u2013 dance over and past yourselves! What does it matter that you didn\u2019t turn out well?\r\n\r\nHow much is still possible! So learn to laugh over and past yourselves! Lift up your hearts, you good dancers, high! higher! And don\u2019t forget good laughter either!\r\n\r\nThis crown of the laughing one, this rose-wreath crown: to you, my brothers, I throw this crown!

This, it seemed to him, was a sign of their convalescence. And so he slipped out into the open and spoke to his animals.</p><p>\u201cWhere is their distress now?\u201d he said, and already he himself was relieved of his minor annoyance. \u201cIn my company, it seems to me, they have unlearned their crying in distress!</p><p>\u2013 Though unfortunately, not their crying.\u201d And Zarathustra covered his ears, for just then the hee-yaw of the ass blended oddly with the noisy jubilation of these higher men.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re having fun,\u201d he began again, \u201cand who knows? Perhaps at the expense of their host; and if they learned to laugh from me, then still it is not my laughing that they learned.</p><p>But what does it matter? They\u2019re old people; they convalesce in their way, they laugh in their way: my ears have endured worse already without becoming testy.</p><p>This day is a triumph; he is already retreating, he\u2019s fleeing, the spirit of gravity, my old arch-enemy! How well this day wants to end, which began so badly and so hard!</p><p>And it wants to end. Already evening is coming; over the sea he rides, this good rider! How he sways, the blissful, homecoming one, in his purple saddle!</p><p>The sky looks on clearly, the world lies deep; oh all you strange people who came to me, it\u2019s worth it indeed to live with me!\u201d</p><p>Thus spoke Zarathustra. And again the cries and laughter of the higher men came from the cave, so he began again.</p><p>\u201cThey are biting, my bait is working, their enemy is retreating from them too, the spirit of gravity. Already they\u2019re learning to laugh at themselves: do I hear correctly?</p><p>My manly fare is working, my vim and vigor sayings; and truly, I did not nourish them with gassy vegetables! But with warrior fare, with conqueror fare \u2013 I awakened new desires in them.</p><p>New hopes live in their arms and legs, their hearts expand. They are finding new words, soon their spirit will breathe mischief.</p><p>Such fare may not be for children, to be sure, nor for longing little women, old and young; their entrails are persuaded differently, their physician and teacher I am not.</p><p>Nausea retreats from these higher men \u2013 well then! That is my victory. In my kingdom they\u2019re becoming secure, all their stupid shame runs away, they\u2019re pouring themselves out.</p><p>They\u2019re pouring out their hearts, good hours are returning to them, they celebrate and ruminate \u2013 they\u2019re becoming grateful.</p><p>That I take as the best sign; they\u2019re becoming grateful. It won\u2019t be long now and they will invent festivals and erect monuments to their old joys.</p><p>They are convalescing!\u201d Thus spoke Zarathustra gaily to his heart and he gazed outward; but his animals pressed up against him and honored his happiness and his silence.</p><h3>2</h3><p>Suddenly, however, Zarathustra\u2019s ears were startled; for the cave which up till now had been full of noise and laughter became deathly still all at once \u2013 but his nose sensed an aromatic smoke and incense, as of burning pine cones.</p><p>\u201cWhat is happening? What are they doing?\u201d he asked himself and crept closer to the entrance, in order to watch his guests surreptitiously. But, wonder of wonders! What did he have to behold with his own eyes?</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019ve all gone pious again, they\u2019re praying, they\u2019re mad!\u201d \u2013 he said and he was amazed beyond measure. And, in truth, all these higher men, the two kings, the retired pope, the wicked magician, the voluntary beggar, the wanderer and his shadow, the old soothsayer, the conscientious of spirit and the ugliest human being \u2013 they all kneeled there like children and devout little old women, and they worshiped the ass. And just then the ugliest human being began to gurgle and snort as though something unspeakable wanted to get out of him; but when he actually put it into words, behold, it was a pious, remarkable litany praising the worshiped and censed ass. This litany, however, sounded thus:</p><p>Amen! And praise and honor and wisdom and thanks and glory and strength be to our god, from everlasting to everlasting!</p><p>\u2013 But to this the ass brayed Hee-yaw.</p><p>He carries our burden, he adopted the form of a servant, he is patient from the heart and never says No; and whoever loves his god, chastises him.</p><p>\u2013 But to this the ass brayed Hee-yaw.</p><p>He does not speak, unless it be to say Yaw to the world that he created; thus he praises his world. It is his slyness that does not speak; this way he is rarely found to be wrong.</p><p>\u2013 But to this the ass brayed Hee-yaw.</p><p>Homely he walks through the world. Gray is the body color in which he cloaks his virtue. If he has spirit, then he conceals it; but everyone believes in his long ears.</p><p>\u2013 But to this the ass brayed Hee-yaw.</p><p>What hidden wisdom is it, that he has long ears and always says Yaw and never No! Has he not created the world in his image, namely as stupid as possible?</p><p>\u2013 But to this the ass brayed Hee-yaw.</p><p>You walk ways that are straight and crooked; it matters little to you what seems straight or crooked to us human beings.

Oh Zarathustra, you hidden one, you annihilator without wrath, you dangerous saint \u2013 you are a rogue!\u201d</p><h3>2</h3><p>But then it happened that Zarathustra, astounded by the sheer number of such roguish answers, bounded back to the door of his cave and, facing all of his guests, cried out with a strong voice:</p><p>\u201cOh you foolish rascals, the lot of you, you jesters! Why do you dissemble and disguise yourselves before me?</p><p>How the hearts of each of you squirmed with glee and malice that at last you had become as little children again, namely pious \u2013</p><p>\u2013 that at last you did again as children do, namely prayed, folded your hands and said \u2018dear God!\u2019</p><p>But now leave me this nursery, my own cave, where today all manner of childishness is at home.

And that\u2019s how it should be.\r\n\r\nBetter to worship God in this form, than in no form at all! Think about this dictum, my exalted friend; you will quickly realize that there is wisdom in such a dictum.\r\n\r\nHe who said \u2018God is a spirit\u2019 \u2013 he took the biggest step and leap ever on earth toward disbelief: such words are not easy to rectify on earth!\r\n\r\nMy old heart leaps and skips at the fact that there is still something to worship on earth. Forgive, oh Zarathustra, an old pious pope\u2019s heart! \u2013\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cAnd you,\u201d said Zarathustra to the wanderer and shadow, \u201cyou call and consider yourself a free spirit?

The old God lives again, oh Zarathustra, say what you will.\r\n\r\nThe ugliest human being is to blame for everything; he has awakened him again. And when he says that he once killed him: death is always a mere prejudice among gods.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cAnd you,\u201d said Zarathustra, \u201cyou wicked old magician, what have you done! Who in these liberated times is supposed to believe in you anymore, if you believe in such asinine divinities?\r\n\r\nWhat you did was a stupidity; how could you, you clever one, commit such a stupidity!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOh Zarathustra,\u201d replied the clever magician, \u201cyou\u2019re right, it was a stupidity \u2013 and it\u2019s been hard enough for me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 \u201cAnd you most of all,\u201d said Zarathustra to the conscientious of spirit, \u201clean your head on your hand and consider!

Oh Zarathustra, you hidden one, you annihilator without wrath, you dangerous saint \u2013 you are a rogue!\u201d\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nBut then it happened that Zarathustra, astounded by the sheer number of such roguish answers, bounded back to the door of his cave and, facing all of his guests, cried out with a strong voice:\r\n\r\n\u201cOh you foolish rascals, the lot of you, you jesters! Why do you dissemble and disguise yourselves before me?\r\n\r\nHow the hearts of each of you squirmed with glee and malice that at last you had become as little children again, namely pious \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 that at last you did again as children do, namely prayed, folded your hands and said \u2018dear God!\u2019\r\n\r\nBut now leave me this nursery, my own cave, where today all manner of childishness is at home.

This you invented in my cave, this I take as a good omen \u2013 such things are invented only by the convalescing!\r\n\r\nAnd if you celebrate it again, this ass festival, do it for your own sake, do it also for my sake!

There at last they all stood together, nothing but old people, but with comforted, brave hearts and inwardly amazed that they felt so good on earth; but the mystery of the night came closer and closer to their hearts. And Zarathustra thought again to himself: \u201cOh how well I like them now, these higher men!\u201d \u2013 but he did not say it aloud, for he honored their happiness and their silence. \u2013</p><p>But then something happened that was the most amazing thing of that amazing long day: the ugliest human being began once more and for the last time to gurgle and to snort, and when he had managed to put it in words, behold, a question leaped round and ready from his mouth, a good, deep, clear question, which moved the hearts of all who were listening to him.</p><p>\u201cMy friends, all of you,\u201d spoke the ugliest human being, \u201cwhat do you think? For the sake of this day \u2013 I am satisfied for the first time that I have lived my entire life.</p><p>And it\u2019s still not enough for me to attest as much as I do. It\u2019s worth it to live on earth: one day, one festival with Zarathustra taught me to love the earth.</p><p>\u2018Was that \u2013 life?\u2019 I want to say to death. \u2018Well then! One More Time!\u2019</p><p>My friends, what do you think? Do you not want to say to death, as I do: Was that \u2013 life? For Zarathustra\u2019s sake, well then! One More Time!\u201d \u2013</p><p>Thus spoke the ugliest human being; but it was not long before midnight. And what do you think happened then? As soon as the higher men had heard his question, all at once they became aware of their transformation and convalescence, and of who gave it to them. Then they rushed toward Zarathustra, thanking, honoring, caressing him, kissing his hands, each in his own manner; such that some laughed, some wept. But the old soothsayer danced with joy; and even if, as some chroniclers opine, he was full of sweet wine at the time, then he was certainly even more full of sweet life and he had renounced all weariness. There are even some who say that the ass also danced then; not for nothing, after all, had the ugliest human being earlier given it wine to drink. Now this may have happened thus or otherwise, and if in truth on that evening the ass did not dance, then clearly even greater and rarer wonders took place there, than the dancing of an ass would have been. In sum, as Zarathustra\u2019s saying goes: \u201cWhat does it matter!\u201d</p><h3>2</h3><p>But as this went on with the ugliest human being, Zarathustra stood there like a drunken man; his tongue slurred, his feet faltered. And who could even guess what thoughts were speeding then through Zarathustra\u2019s soul? Visibly, however, his spirit receded and flew ahead and was in remote distances and at the same time \u201cupon a high ridge,\u201d as it is written, \u201cbetween two seas,</p><p>\u2013 between the past and the future, wandering as a heavy cloud.\u201d Gradually, however, as the higher men held him in their arms, he came to himself a bit and used his hands to fend away the throng of the revering and the worrying; yet he did not speak. All at once though he quickly turned his head, because he seemed to hear something: then he put his finger to his lips and said: \u201cCome!\u201d</p><p>And immediately it became still and mysterious all around; but from the depths the sound of a bell rose slowly. Zarathustra listened for it, as did the higher men; then he put his finger to his lips once more and said again: \u201cCome! Come! It\u2019s going on midnight!\u201d \u2013 And his voice had changed. But still he did not stir from his place; then it grew even more still and mysterious, and everything listened, even the ass, and Zarathustra\u2019s animals of honor, the eagle and the snake, and also the cave of Zarathustra and the big cool moon and the very night. But Zarathustra put his hand to his lips for the third time and said:</p><p>\u201cCome! Come! Come! Let us walk now! It is the hour: let us walk now into the night! \u201d</p><h3>3</h3><p>You higher men, it\u2019s going on midnight; I want to whisper something in your ears, like that old bell whispers it into my ear \u2013</p><p>\u2013 as secretly, as terribly, as cordially as that midnight bell, which has experienced more than any human, says it to me:</p><p>\u2013 which long ago tallied the heartbeat beatings of your fathers \u2013 oh! oh! how it sighs! How it laughs in dream delight, the old, the deep deep midnight!</p><p>Still! Still! Then things are heard that by day may not be said; but now, in the cool air, where the noise of your hearts has fled \u2013</p><p>\u2013 now it speaks, now it listens, now it creeps into nocturnal, over-awake souls \u2013 oh! oh! how it sighs! How it laughs in dream delight!</p><p>\u2013 don\u2019t you hear, how it secretly, terribly, cordially speaks to you, the old, the deep deep midnight?</p><p>Oh mankind, pray!</p><h3>4</h3><p>Woe to me! Where has time gone? Did I not sink into deep wells? The world sleeps \u2013</p><p>Alas! Alas! The dog howls, the moon shines. I would sooner die, die, than tell you what my midnight heart is thinking right now.</p><p>Now I\u2019ve died already. It\u2019s gone. Spider, why do you spin around me? Do you want blood? Oh! Oh! The dew falls, the hour comes \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the hour when I shiver and freeze, which asks and asks and asks: \u201cwho has enough heart for it?</p><p>\u2013 who shall be the ruler of the earth? Who wants to say: thus you shall flow, you great and little streams!\u201d</p><p>\u2013 the hour approaches: oh mankind, you higher men, pray! This speech is for fine ears, for your ears \u2013 what does deep midnight have to say?</p><h3>5</h3><p>It carries me away, my soul dances. Day\u2019s work! Day\u2019s work! Who shall be ruler of the earth?</p><p>The moon is cool, the wind is silent. Alas! Alas! Have you flown high enough? You dance: but a leg is not a wing.</p><p>You good dancers, now all joy is gone, wine became resin, every cup became brittle, the graves stammer.</p><p>You did not fly high enough; now the graves stammer: \u201cRedeem the dead! Why is it night for so long? Does the moon not make us drunk?\u201d</p><p>You higher men, redeem the graves, awaken the corpses! Oh, why does the worm still bore? It approaches, the hour approaches \u2013</p><p>\u2013 the bell growls, the heart still rattles, the wood worm still bores, the heart worm. Alas! Alas! The world is deep!</p><h3>6</h3><p>Sweet lyre! Sweet lyre! I love your tone, your drunken, sunken croaking tone! \u2013 From how long ago, from how far away your tone comes to me, from afar, from ponds of love!</p><p>You old bell, you sweet lyre!

You higher men, do you not smell it? A fragrance wells up mysteriously,</p><p>\u2013 a fragrance and aroma of eternity, a rosy blissful, brown golden wine aroma of ancient happiness,</p><p>\u2013 of drunken, midnight, dying happiness, which sings: the world is deep and deeper than the grasp of day!</p><h3>7</h3><p>Let me be! Let me be! I am too pure for you. Do not touch me! Did my world not just become perfect?</p><p>My skin is too pure for your hands. Let me be, you stupid, clumsy, stifling day!

Reach for god\u2019s pain, not for me! What am I? A drunken sweet lyre \u2013</p><p>a midnight lyre, a bell-toad that no one understands, but that must speak, before the deaf, you higher men! For you do not understand me!</p><p>Gone! Gone! Oh youth! Oh noon! Oh afternoon! Now evening\u2019s come and night and midnight \u2013 the dog howls, the wind:</p><p>\u2013 is the wind not a dog? It whimpers, it yelps, it howls. Alas! Oh how midnight sighs, how it laughs, how it rattles and wheezes!</p><p>How she speaks soberly just now, this drunken poetess! Perhaps she overdrank her drunkenness? She became over-awake? She ruminates?</p><p>\u2013 she ruminates her pain, in dream, the old deep midnight, and even more her joy. Because joy, even if pain is deep: Joy is deeper still than misery.</p><h3>9</h3><p>You grapevine! Why do you praise me! I cut you! I am cruel, you bleed \u2013 what does your praise want of my drunken cruelty?</p><p>\u201cWhat became perfect, everything ripe \u2013 wants to die!\u201d so you speak. Blessed, blessed be the vintner\u2019s knife! But everything unripe wants to live, alas!</p><p>Pain says: \u201cRefrain! Away, you pain!\u201d But everything that suffers wants to live, to become ripe and joyful and longing,</p><p>\u2013 longing for what is farther, higher, brighter. \u201cI want heirs,\u201d thus speaks all that suffers, \u201cI want children, I do not want myself \u201d \u2013</p><p>But joy does not want heirs, not children \u2013 joy wants itself, wants eternity, wants recurrence, wants everything eternally the same.</p><p>Pain says: \u201cBreak, bleed, heart! Walk, legs! Wings, fly! Up! Upward! Pain!\u201d Well then, well now, old heart! Pain says: \u201cRefrain! \u201d</p><h3>10</h3><p>You higher men, what do you think? Am I a soothsayer? A dreamer? A drunk? A dream interpreter? A midnight bell?</p><p>A drop of dew? A haze and fragrance of eternity? Do you not hear it? Do you not smell it? Just now my world became perfect, midnight is also noon \u2013</p><p>Pain is also a joy, a curse is also a blessing, night is also a sun \u2013 go away or else you will learn: a wise man is also a fool.</p><p>Have you ever said Yes to one joy? Oh my friends, then you also said Yes to all pain. All things are enchained, entwined, enamored \u2013</p><p>\u2013 if you ever wanted one time two times, if you ever said \u201cI like you, happiness! Whoosh!

You dance: but a leg is not a wing.\r\n\r\nYou good dancers, now all joy is gone, wine became resin, every cup became brittle, the graves stammer.\r\n\r\nYou did not fly high enough; now the graves stammer: \u201cRedeem the dead! Why is it night for so long? Does the moon not make us drunk?\u201d\r\n\r\nYou higher men, redeem the graves, awaken the corpses! Oh, why does the worm still bore? It approaches, the hour approaches \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 the bell growls, the heart still rattles, the wood worm still bores, the heart worm. Alas! Alas! The world is deep!\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nSweet lyre! Sweet lyre! I love your tone, your drunken, sunken croaking tone! \u2013 From how long ago, from how far away your tone comes to me, from afar, from ponds of love!\r\n\r\nYou old bell, you sweet lyre! Every pain tore into your heart, father pain, fathers\u2019 pain, forefathers\u2019 pain, your speech grew ripe \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 ripe like golden autumns and afternoons, like my hermit\u2019s heart \u2013 now you speak: the world itself became ripe, the grape turns brown,\r\n\r\n\u2013 now it wants to die, die of happiness. You higher men, do you not smell it? A fragrance wells up mysteriously,\r\n\r\n\u2013 a fragrance and aroma of eternity, a rosy blissful, brown golden wine aroma of ancient happiness,\r\n\r\n\u2013 of drunken, midnight, dying happiness, which sings: the world is deep and deeper than the grasp of day!\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nLet me be! Let me be! I am too pure for you. Do not touch me! Did my world not just become perfect?\r\n\r\nMy skin is too pure for your hands. Let me be, you stupid, clumsy, stifling day! Is midnight not brighter?\r\n\r\nThe purest shall be rulers of the earth, the least known, strongest, the midnight-souled, who are brighter and deeper than any day.\r\n\r\nOh day, you grope for me? You fumble for my happiness? I seem rich to you, lonely, buried treasure, a chamber of gold?\r\n\r\nOh world, you want me? Am I worldly to you? Am I spiritual to you? Am I godlike to you? But day and world, you are too crude \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 have smarter hands, reach for deeper happiness, for deeper unhappiness, reach for some kind of god \u2013 do not reach for me:\r\n\r\n\u2013 my unhappiness, my happiness is deep, you strange day, but still I am no god, no god\u2019s hell: deep is its pain.\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nGod\u2019s pain is deeper, you strange world! Reach for god\u2019s pain, not for me! What am I? A drunken sweet lyre \u2013\r\n\r\na midnight lyre, a bell-toad that no one understands, but that must speak, before the deaf, you higher men! For you do not understand me!\r\n\r\nGone! Gone! Oh youth! Oh noon! Oh afternoon! Now evening\u2019s come and night and midnight \u2013 the dog howls, the wind:\r\n\r\n\u2013 is the wind not a dog? It whimpers, it yelps, it howls. Alas! Oh how midnight sighs, how it laughs, how it rattles and wheezes!\r\n\r\nHow she speaks soberly just now, this drunken poetess! Perhaps she overdrank her drunkenness? She became over-awake? She ruminates?\r\n\r\n\u2013 she ruminates her pain, in dream, the old deep midnight, and even more her joy. Because joy, even if pain is deep: Joy is deeper still than misery.\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\nYou grapevine! Why do you praise me! I cut you! I am cruel, you bleed \u2013 what does your praise want of my drunken cruelty?\r\n\r\n\u201cWhat became perfect, everything ripe \u2013 wants to die!\u201d so you speak. Blessed, blessed be the vintner\u2019s knife! But everything unripe wants to live, alas!\r\n\r\nPain says: \u201cRefrain! Away, you pain!\u201d But everything that suffers wants to live, to become ripe and joyful and longing,\r\n\r\n\u2013 longing for what is farther, higher, brighter. \u201cI want heirs,\u201d thus speaks all that suffers, \u201cI want children, I do not want myself \u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nBut joy does not want heirs, not children \u2013 joy wants itself, wants eternity, wants recurrence, wants everything eternally the same.\r\n\r\nPain says: \u201cBreak, bleed, heart! Walk, legs! Wings, fly! Up! Upward! Pain!\u201d Well then, well now, old heart! Pain says: \u201cRefrain! \u201d\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nYou higher men, what do you think? Am I a soothsayer? A dreamer? A drunk? A dream interpreter? A midnight bell?\r\n\r\nA drop of dew? A haze and fragrance of eternity? Do you not hear it? Do you not smell it? Just now my world became perfect, midnight is also noon \u2013\r\n\r\nPain is also a joy, a curse is also a blessing, night is also a sun \u2013 go away or else you will learn: a wise man is also a fool.\r\n\r\nHave you ever said Yes to one joy? Oh my friends, then you also said Yes to all pain. All things are enchained, entwined, enamored \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 if you ever wanted one time two times, if you ever said \u201cI like you, happiness! Whoosh! Moment!\u201d then you wanted everything back!\r\n\r\n\u2013 Everything anew, everything eternal, everything enchained, entwined, enamored, oh thus you loved the world \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 you eternal ones, love it eternally and for all time; and say to pain also: refrain, but come back! For all joy wants \u2013 eternity!\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nAll joy want the eternity of all things, wants honey, wants resin, wants drunken midnight, wants graves, wants tomb-tears\u2019 solace, wants gilded sunset \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 what does joy not want? It is thirstier, heartier, hungrier, more terrible, more mysterious than all pain, it wants itself, it bites into itself, the ring\u2019s will wrestles in it \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 it wants love, it wants hate, it is super-rich, bestows, throws away, begs for someone to take it, thanks the taker, it would like to be hated \u2013\r\n\r\n\u2013 so rich is its joy that it thirsts for pain, for hell, for hate, for disgrace, for the cripple, for world \u2013 this world, oh you know it well!\r\n\r\nYou higher men, it longs for you, does joy, the unruly, blissful one \u2013 for your pain, you failures! All eternal joy longs for failures.\r\n\r\nFor all joy wants itself, and therefore it wants all misery too! Oh happiness, oh pain! Oh break, my heart! You higher men, learn this, joy wants eternity,\r\n\r\n\u2013 Joy wants the eternity of all things, wants deep, wants deep eternity!\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nHave you now learned my song? Have you guessed what it means? Well then! Well now! You higher men, then sing me my new roundelay!\r\n\r\nSing me this song yourselves now, whose name is \u201cOne More Time,\u201d whose meaning is \u201cin all eternity!\u201d \u2013 sing, you higher men, Zarathustra\u2019s roundelay!\r\n\r\nOh mankind, pray!\r\nWhat does deep midnight have to say?\r\n\u201cFrom sleep, from sleep \u2013\r\nFrom deepest dream I made my way: \u2013\r\nThe world is deep,\r\nAnd deeper than the grasp of day.\r\nDeep is its pain \u2013,\r\nJoy \u2013 deeper still than misery:\r\nPain says: Refrain!\r\nYet all joy wants eternity \u2013\r\n\u2013 Wants deep, wants deep eternity.\u201d"}, "id": 96}, {"data": {"uuid": "af39d895-9ff1-46bd-9880-4210eac69932", "user": 1, "title": "The Sign", "created_on": "2023-05-10 17:05:15.573350+00:00", "updated_on": "2023-05-10 17:05:15.593663+00:00", "article_html": "<h2>The Sign</h2><p>But in the morning after this night Zarathustra sprang from his sleeping place, girded his loins and came out from his cave, glowing and strong, like a morning sun that emerges from dark mountains.</p><p>\u201cYou great star,\u201d he said, as he had said before, \u201cwhat would all your happiness be if you did not have those for whom you shine?</p><p>And if they stayed in their rooms while you are already awake and come and bestow and distribute \u2013 how would your proud shame be angered!</p><p>Well then!

Oh Zarathustra, he said to me, I come to seduce you to your last sin.\r\n\r\n\u201cTo my last sin?\u201d cried Zarathustra, and laughed scornfully at his own words. \u201cWhat has been left me now as my last sin?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u2013 And once more Zarathustra became immersed in himself and sat down again on the great stone, and he reflected. Suddenly he jumped to his feet \u2013\r\n\r\n\u201cPity! Pity for the higher men!\u201d he cried, and his face transformed to bronze. \u201cWell then! That \u2013 has its time!\r\n\r\nMy suffering and my pity \u2013 what do they matter! Do I strive for happiness? I strive for my work!\r\n\r\nWell then! The lion came, my children are near, Zarathustra became ripe, my hour came \u2013\r\n\r\nThis is my morning, my day is beginning: up now, up, you great noon! \u201d \u2013\r\n\r\nThus spoke Zarathustra and he left his cave, glowing and strong, like a morning sun that emerges from dark mountains.\r\n\r\n\u2217\u2217\u2217\r\n\r\nThe end of Thus Spoke Zarathustra"}, "id": 97}]}]}]
