Here he enjoyed his spirit and his solitude and for ten years he did not tire of it. But at last his heart transformed, – one morning he arose with the dawn, stepped before the sun and spoke thus to it:</p><p>“You great star! What would your happiness be if you had not those for whom you shine?</p><p>For ten years you have come up here to my cave: you would have tired of your light and of this route without me, my eagle and my snake.</p><p>But we awaited you every morning, took your overflow from you and blessed you for it.</p><p>Behold! I am weary of my wisdom, like a bee that has gathered too much honey. I need hands that reach out.</p><p>I want to bestow and distribute until the wise among human beings have once again enjoyed their folly, and the poor once again their wealth.</p><p>For this I must descend into the depths, as you do evenings when you go behind the sea and bring light even to the underworld, you super-rich star!</p><p>Like you, I must go <em>down</em> as the human beings say, to whom I want to descend.</p><p>So bless me now, you quiet eye that can look upon even an all too great happiness without envy!</p><p>Bless the cup that wants to flow over, such that water flows golden from it and everywhere carries the reflection of your bliss!</p><p>Behold! This cup wants to become empty again, and Zarathustra wants to become human again.”</p><p>– Thus began Zarathustra’s going under.</p><h3>2</h3><p>Zarathustra climbed down the mountain alone and he came across no one.<br>But when he came to the forest, an old man stood before him, one who had left<br>his holy hut to search for roots in the forest. And thus spake the old man to Zar-<br>athustra:</p><p>“This wanderer is no stranger to me: many years ago he passed by here. Zarathustra he was called; but he has changed.</p><p>At that time you carried your ashes to the mountain: would you now carry your fire into the valleys? Do you not fear the arsonist’s penalty?</p><p>Yes, I recognize Zarathustra. Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurks about his mouth. Does he not move along like a dancer?</p><p>Changed is Zarathustra, become a child is Zarathustra, an awakened one is Zarathustra: what do you want now with those who sleep?</p><p>As though in a sea you have lived in your solitude, and the sea has borne you up. Alas, you want to go ashore? Alas, you want to drag your body around again, yourself?</p><p>Zarathustra answered: “I love mankind.”</p><p>“Why,” said the holy man, “do you think I went into the forest and into solitude? Was it not because I loved man all too much?</p><p>Now I love God: man, I do not love. Man is too imperfect a thing for me. The love of mankind would kill me.”</p><p>Zarathustra answered: “Did I speak of love? I am bringing mankind a gift.”</p><p>“Give them nothing,” said the holy man. “Take something from them rather and carry it with you — that would suit them best: if only it suits you!</p><p>And if you want to give them something, give no more than an alms, and let<br>them beg for that!”</p><p>“No,” answered Zarathustra, “I give no alms. I am not poor enough for that!”</p><p>The holy man laughed at Zarathustra and spoke thus: “Well, see to it that they accept your treasures! They are mistrustful of hermits and do not believe that we come in order to give.</p><p>Our steps ring too lonely through the streets. And what if at night in their beds they should hear a man walking, long before the sun comes up, then they probably ask themselves: where is that thief going?</p><p>Remain in the forest and do not go to man. Go rather to the animals, even! Why not be like me — a bear among bears, a bird among birds?”</p><p>“And what does the holy man do in the forest?” asked Zarathustra.</p><p>The holy man answered: “I make songs and sing them, and when I make songs I laugh, cry, and hum: thus I praise God.</p><p>With singing, crying, laughing, and humming I praise the God that is my God. But what do you bring us as a gift?”</p><p>When Zarathustra heard these words, he saluted the holy man and said:</p><p>“What would I have to give you? But let me hurry away quickly, lest I take something instead!”— And so they parted from each other, the old man and Zarathustra, laughing like two boys.</p><p>But when Zarathustra was alone, he spoke thus to his heart: “Could it be possible, then? This old saint in his forest has heard nothing yet about God being dead.”</p><h3>3</h3><p>When Zarathustra came to the next town which lay by the forest, he found many people gathered in the marketplace there: for it had been promised that a tightrope walker would be seen. And thus spake Zarathustra to the people:</p><p>“I teach you the Superman. Man is something that must be overcome. What have you done to overcome him?</p><p>All beings hitherto have created something beyond themselves. And you would be the ebb of this great flood, to return even to the beast rather than overcome the man?</p><p>What is the ape to man? A laughingstock or an object of shame. And that is just what man shall be for the Superman: a laughingstock or an object of shame.</p><p>You have made your way from worm to man, and much in you is still worm. Once you were apes, and even now man is still more of an ape than any ape.</p><p>But he who is wisest among you is likewise only a hotbed and hybrid of plant and phantom. But do I command you to become plants or phantoms?</p><p>Behold, I teach you the Superman!</p><p>The Superman is the meaning of the earth. Let your will say: the Superman shall be the meaning of the earth!</p><p>I entreat you, my brothers, remain true to the earth and do not believe those who hold out supernatural hopes for you. They are poisoners, whether they know it or not.</p><p>They are despisers of life, dying ones and poisoned themselves; the earth is sick of them — let them leave it, then!</p><p>Once the sin against God was the greatest sin; but God died, and with that these sinners died, too. Now the worst sin is the sin against the earth, to regard the innards of the inscrutable more highly than the meaning of the earth.</p><p>Once the soul looked upon the body with contempt: and at that time this contempt was the highest thing: the soul wanted the body scrawny, scary, starved. Thus the soul thought to escape the body and the earth.</p><p>Oh, this soul was itself still scrawny, scary, and starved; and cruelty was the delight of this soul!</p><p>But you as well, my brothers, tell me: what does your body proclaim about your soul? Is your soul not dearth and dirt and a wretched comfort?</p><p>Verily, man is a filthy stream. One must be a veritable sea in order to absorb such a filthy stream and not become unclean.</p><p>Behold, I teach you the Superman: he is that sea, in him your great contempt can be submerged.</p><p>What is the greatest thing you can experience? It is the hour of great contempt, when even your happiness turns to disgust, and your reason and virtue too.</p><p>The hour when you say: ‘What does my happiness matter? It is dearth and dirt and a wretched comfort. But my happiness should justify being itself!’</p><p>The hour when you say: ‘What does my reason matter: Does it not crave knowledge the same way a lion craves food? It is dearth and dirt and a wretched comfort!’</p><p>The hour when you say: ‘What does my virtue matter? It has not yet made me mad. How weary I am of my good and evil! That is all dearth and dirt and a wretched comfort!’</p><p>The hour when you say: ‘What does my justice matter? I do not see that I am fire and coal. But the just are fire and coal.’</p><p>The hour when you say: ‘What does my pity matter: Is pity not the cross upon which he who loves mankind is nailed? But my pity is no crucifixion.’</p><p>Have you ever spoken thus? Have you ever cried thus? Alas, if only I had ever heard you cry thus!</p><p>Not your sin but your complacency cries out against heaven, the very stinginess of your sin cries out against heaven!</p><p>Where is the lighting which licks you with its tongue? Where is the madness with which you should be injected?</p><p>Behold, I teach you the Superman: he is that lightning, he is that madness!”—</p><p>When Zarathustra had spoken thus, someone from the crowd cried out: “We have heard enough from the tightrope walker; now let us see him, too!” And all the people laughed at Zarathustra. The tightrope walker, however, who thought these words applied to him, set about his task.</p>"
